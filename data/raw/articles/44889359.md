## Coalton Playground: Type-Safe Lisp in Your Browser

I wanted to share a side project I’ve been tinkering with for a while and finally got around to shipping: **Coalton Playground** – basically a web-based REPL for Coalton, which is this interesting statically-typed Lisp dialect.

## So What’s Coalton?

If you haven’t heard of it, [Coalton](https://coalton-lang.github.io) is kind of a weird (_in a good way_) mashup – it takes Haskell’s type system and plants it right in the middle of Common Lisp. You get all the type safety stuff like algebraic data types and pattern matching, but it still plays nice with “regular” Lisp code.

Or, as the [official site](https://coalton-lang.github.io/about/) puts it: “_Coalton is an efficient, statically typed functional programming language that supercharges Common Lisp_“

## Why I Built This

I wanted to play with Coalton but setting up a Lisp environment felt like too much work. You need [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org), then [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/), then install Coalton… and by that point I’d usually get distracted by something else.

So I figured I’d make a playground where you can mess around with it right in the browser.

## Here’s What It Looks Like

Pretty straightforward – you write Coalton code like this:

(coalton-toplevel
  (declare fib (Integer -> Integer))
  (define (fib n)
    (if (<= n 1) n
        (+ (fib (- n 1))
           (fib (- n 2))))))

(cl:format cl:t "fib(10) = ~A~%" (coalton:coalton (fib 10)))

Hit run, and you get your output. Then, click on “_Generated Code_” to see equivalent Common Lisp.

A screenshot of one example:

## The Fun Technical Bits

Getting this to run fast enough was actually kind of interesting. Turns out you can _pre-build SBCL cores with Coalton already loaded_, which cuts the startup time from ~400ms to ~80ms. Small win, but it makes the whole thing feel snappier.

\[**Warning**: not built for scale right now, subject to random errors, unavailability, etc\]

## Want to Try It?

If you’re curious about what statically-typed Lisp feels like, or you just want to procrastinate for a few minutes, go check it out.

I threw in some examples to get you started – basic stuff like factorial and fibonacci, plus some fancier things like monads if you’re into that.

Anyway, that’s it. _Just wanted to share this thing I made_.
