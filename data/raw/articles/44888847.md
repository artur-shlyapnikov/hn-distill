## Why StackBench?

Most documentation fails when agents try to use it. Here's how we fix that.

### The Old Way

✗

#### Hope and Pray

Write docs, ship code, hope agents understand it

✗

#### Manual Testing

Manually test with ChatGPT, get inconsistent results

✗

#### Late Discovery

Find out in production that agents can't use your API

### The StackBench Way

✓

#### Automated Analysis

Real agents test your code across multiple scenarios

✓

#### Actionable Reports

Get specific fixes ranked by impact on agent success

✓

#### Continuous Monitoring (coming soon)

Track agent-readiness over time as your code evolves

## How StackBench Works

StackBench simulates how coding agents actually use your library documentation. We extract real use cases, then test if agents can implement them successfully.

Phase 1

### Extract Use Cases

We analyze your documentation to find realistic scenarios that developers would actually implement.

Smart Doc Scanning

Clone repo and scan .md/.mdx files for code examples

AI Analysis

Advanced AI extracts realistic use cases from documentation

Diversity Optimization

15 distinct cases across beginner to advanced complexity

Phase 2

### Agent Testing

Coding agents attempt to implement each use case using only your documentation as a guide.

Isolated Execution

Each use case runs in its own Docker container

Real Constraints

Read-only docs with realistic testing environment

Complete Tracing

Complete tracing logs for the analysis agent

### What You Get

Detailed insights into how well your documentation works with coding agents

#### Success Rate

See exactly which use cases agents can implement successfully

#### Failure Analysis

Understand why agents fail and what's missing from docs

#### Agent Traces

Full execution logs showing agent decision-making process
