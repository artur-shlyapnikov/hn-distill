# Debian 13 trixie released

**August 9th, 2025**

After 2 years, 1 month, and 30 days of development, the Debian project is proud to present its new stable version 13 (code name trixie).

trixie will be supported for the next 5 years thanks to the combined work of the [Debian Security team](https://security-team.debian.org/) and the [Debian Long Term Support](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) team.

Debian 13 trixie ships with several desktop environments, such as:

*   GNOME 48,
*   KDE Plasma 6.3,
*   LXDE 13,
*   LXQt 2.1.0,
*   Xfce 4.20

This release contains over **14,100** new packages for a total count of **69,830** packages, while over **8,840** packages have been removed as obsolete. **44,326** packages were updated in this release. The overall disk usage for trixie is **403,854,660 kB (403 GB)**, and is made up of **1,463,291,186** lines of code.

Thanks to our translators who have made the **man**\-pages for trixie available in multiple languages.

The manpages-l10n project has contributed many improved and new translations for manual pages. Especially Romanian and Polish translations are greatly enhanced since bookworm. All architectures other than i386 now use a 64-bit time\_t ABI, supporting dates beyond 2038. Debian contributors have made significant progress towards ensuring package builds produce byte-for-byte reproducible results. You can check the status for packages installed on your system using the new package debian-repro-status, or visit [reproduce.debian.net](https://reproduce.debian.net/) for Debian's overall statistics for trixie and newer.

Debian 13 trixie includes numerous updated software packages (over 63% of all packages from the previous release), such as:

*   Apache 2.4.64
*   Bash 5.2.37
*   BIND DNS Server 9.20
*   Cryptsetup 2.7
*   curl/libcurl 8.14.1
*   Emacs 30.1
*   Exim (default email server) 4.98
*   GNUcash 5.10
*   GNU Compiler Collection 14.2
*   GIMP 3.0.4
*   GnuPG 2.4.7
*   Inkscape 1.4
*   the GNU C Library 2.41
*   LibreOffice 25.2
*   Linux kernel 6.12 LTS series
*   LLVM/Clang toolchain 19 (default), 17 and 18 available
*   MariaDB 11.8
*   Nginx 1.26
*   OpenJDK 21
*   OpenLDAP 2.6.10
*   OpenSSH 10.0p1
*   OpenSSL 3.5
*   Perl 5.40
*   PHP 8.4
*   Postfix 3.10
*   PostgreSQL 17
*   Python 3, 3.13
*   Rustc 1.85
*   Samba 4.22
*   Systemd 257
*   Vim 9.1

With this broad selection of packages and its traditional wide architecture support, Debian once again stays true to its goal of being The Universal Operating System. It is suitable for many different use cases: from desktop systems to netbooks; from development servers to cluster systems; and for database, web, and storage servers. At the same time, additional quality assurance efforts like automatic installation and upgrade tests for all packages in Debian's archive ensure that trixie fulfills the high expectations that users have of a stable Debian release.

This release for the first time officially supports the riscv64 architecture, allowing users to run Debian on 64-bit RISC-V hardware and benefit from all Debian 13 features. A total of seven architectures are officially supported for trixie:

trixie*   64-bit PC (amd64),
*   64-bit ARM (arm64),
*   ARM EABI (armel),
*   ARMv7 (EABI hard-float ABI, armhf),
*   64-bit little-endian PowerPC (ppc64el),
*   64-bit little-endian RISC-V (riscv64),
*   IBM System z (s390x)

i386 is no longer supported as a regular architecture: there is no official kernel and no Debian installer for i386 systems. The i386 architecture is now only intended to be used on a 64-bit (amd64) CPU. Users running i386 systems should not upgrade to trixie. Instead, Debian recommends either reinstalling them as amd64, where possible, or retiring the hardware.

trixie will be the last release for the armel architecture. See [5.1.3. Last release for armel](../../releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#last-release-for-armel) in the release notes for more information on our ARM EABI support.

The Debian Cloud team publishes trixie for several cloud computing services:

*   Amazon EC2 (amd64 and arm64),
*   Microsoft Azure (amd64),
*   OpenStack (generic) (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),
*   PlainVM (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),
*   NoCloud (amd64, arm64, ppc64el)

The genericcloud image should be able to run in any virtualised environment, and there is also a nocloud image which is useful for testing the build process.

Cloud images provide automation hooks via \`\`cloud-init\`\` and prioritize fast instance startup using specifically optimized kernel packages and grub configurations.

### Want to give it a try?

If you simply want to try Debian 13 trixie without installing it, you can use one of the available [live images](../../CD/live/) which load and run the complete operating system in a read-only state via your computer's memory.

These live images are provided for the `amd64` and `arm64` architectures and are available for DVDs, USB sticks, and netboot setups. The user can choose among different desktop environments to try: GNOME, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, LXQt, and Xfce. Debian Live trixie has a standard live image, so it is also possible to try a base Debian system without any of the graphical user interfaces.

Should you enjoy the operating system you have the option of installing from the live image onto your computer's hard disk. The live image includes the Calamares independent installer as well as the standard Debian Installer. More information is available in the [release notes](../../releases/trixie/releasenotes) and the [live install images](../../CD/live/) sections of the Debian website. Multi-architecture Debian trixie container images are also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) . In addition to the standard images, a slim variant is available to reduce disk usage. The Debian Installer and Debian Live Images can now be booted using HTTP Boot on supported UEFI and U-Boot firmware.

To install Debian 13 trixie directly onto your computer's storage device you can choose from a variety of installation media types to [Download](https://www.debian.org/download) such as: Blu-ray Disc, DVD, CD, USB stick, or via a network connection. See the [Installation Guide](../../releases/trixie/installmanual) for more details.

Debian can now be installed in 78 languages, with most of them available in both text-based and graphical user interfaces.

The installation images may be downloaded right now via [bittorrent](../../CD/torrent-cd/) (the recommended method), [jigdo](../../CD/jigdo-cd/#which), or [HTTP](../../CD/http-ftp/); see [Debian on CDs](../../CD/) for further information. trixie will soon be available on physical DVD, CD-ROM, and Blu-ray Discs from numerous [vendors](../../CD/vendors) too.

### Upgrading Debian

Upgrades to Debian 13 trixie from the previous release, Debian 12 bookworm, are automatically handled by the APT package management tool for most configurations.

Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that you make a full backup, or at least back up any data or configuration information you can't afford to lose. The upgrade tools and process are quite reliable, but a hardware failure in the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely damaged system.

The main things you'll want to back up are the contents of /etc, /var/lib/dpkg, /var/lib/apt/extended\_states and the output of:

`$ dpkg --get-selections '*' # (the quotes are important)`

We welcome any information from users related to the upgrade from bookworm to trixie. Please share information by filing a bug in the [Debian bug tracking system](../../releases/trixie/amd64/release-notes/ch-about.en.html#upgrade-reports) using the **upgrade-reports** package with your results.

There has been a lot of development on the Debian Installer since its previous official release with Debian 12, resulting in improved hardware support and some very useful new features such as

*   Improved hardware and software support for speech synthesis
*   Initial and restricted support for rescuing Debian installed to a btrfs subvolume
*   Changed default unit from MB to GB when partitioning disks
*   Disabled cdrom sources if installation medium is not a real CD (USB stick, SD card, ISO file), because APT cannot use it after the installation
*   Plus support for secure boot with systemd-boot

It is advisable to remove bookworm-backports entries from APT source-list files before the upgrade; after the upgrade consider adding **trixie-backports**.

If your APT configuration also involves pinning or `APT::Default-Release`, it is likely to require adjustments to allow the upgrade of packages to the new stable release. Please consider [disabling APT pinning](../../releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.html#disabling-apt-pinning).

Under some circumstances, issues might arise during the upgrade process, or while running trixie.

For instance, the TLS support in the OpenLDAP client **libldap2** and server **slapd** is now provided by OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS. This affects the available configuration options, as well as their behavior. If no TLS CA certificates are specified, the system default trust store will now be loaded automatically. If you do not want the default CAs to be used, you must configure the trusted CAs explicitly. For more information about LDAP client configuration, see the [ldap.conf.5](https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/ldap.conf.5) man page.

We have documented this and other possible issues at [5\. Issues to be aware of for trixie](../../releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html) in the release notes. You're advised to read that before upgrading.

As always, Debian systems may be upgraded painlessly, in place, without any forced downtime, but it is strongly recommended to read the [release notes](../../releases/trixie/releasenotes) as well as the [installation guide](../../releases/trixie/installmanual) for possible issues, and for detailed instructions on installing and upgrading. The release notes will be further improved and translated to additional languages in the weeks after the release.
