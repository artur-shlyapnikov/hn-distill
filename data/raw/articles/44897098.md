Convo-Lang  

# Convo-Lang

_\>\_ The language of AI_

Convo-Lang is an open source AI-native programming language and ecosystem designed specifically for building powerful, structured prompts and agent workflows for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, Llama, DeepSeek, and more.

**Instead of just writing prompts as freeform English, you use Convo-Lang to:**

*   **Define multi-step conversations** between users and LLM agents, with full control of the narrative.
*   **Add structure, state, and variables** to your prompts, making your LLM applications easier to reason about, test, and maintain.
*   **Define functions and tools** directly in your prompts that LLMs knows exactly how to use.
*   **Connect to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) providers** with a single line of code, integrating knowledge sources like vector databases.
*   **Switch between LLM models and providers** to avoid vendor lock-in and to use the best model for the task at hand.
*   **Create custom thinking algorithms** to guide agents down a structured path using a mix of natural language and procedural programming.
*   **Define concrete data types** within your prompts that can be used to extract or generate structured data.

_Curious to see what a Convo-Lang script looks like? Here’s an example:_

welcome-to-convo-lang.convo

```convo
// Imports allow you to use code from existing Convo scripts
@import ./about-convo-chain-of-thought.convo
@import ./user-state.convo


// Define messages allow you to define variables that can
// reused else where in your prompt
> define
langName="Convo-Lang"


// System messages can be used to controls the behaviour and
// personality of the LLM and are hidden from the user
> system
You are a fun and exciting teacher introducing the user to {{langName}}.
{{langName}} is an AI native programming language.


@condition = isNewVisitor
> assistant
Hello 👋, welcome to the {{langName}} learning site


@condition = not(isNewVisitor)
> assistant
Welcome Back to {{langName}}, it's good to see you again 😊


// This imports adds menu with suggestions the user can click on
@import ./welcome-suggestions.convo
```

## Quick Start

**Are you already convinced and want to start using Convo-Lang now?**

Use the Convo-Lang CLI to create a new NextJS app pre-configured with Convo-Lang and pre-built demo agents.

```sh
npx @convo-lang/convo-lang-cli --create-next-app
```

**And don't forget to install the Convo-Lang [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IYIO.convo-lang-tools) for syntax highlighting and other Convo-Lang development tools.**

Search "Convo-Lang" in the extensions panel.

## Why use Convo-Lang

While LLMs “understand” English for simple prompting, building robust AI apps requires much more:

*   Structure, state, and version control
*   Auditable and readable multi-step logic
*   Reliable tool/function integration
*   Typed data and standardized function signatures
*   Easy debugging and extensibility

Convo-Lang standardizes prompting and AI agent workflows in the same way SQL standardized interacting with databases—by giving you a readable, powerful language that works across providers, tools, and teams.

Using advanced prompting techniques such as tool calling, RAG, structured data, etc, are all greatly simplified allowing you to focus on the business logic of designing agentic experiences instead of managing dependency chains or learning how to use bespoke interfaces that only solve problems for a limited use case.

## Key Features

*   [Multi model support](#multi-model-support)
*   [Ease of Readability](#ease-of-readability)
*   [Simplified Tool Use](#simplified-tool-use)
*   [Flexible RAG Support](#flexible-rag-support)
*   [Transparency and Auditability](#transparency-and-auditability)

### Multi model support

Transition between multiple models seamlessly without reformating prompts. Convo-Lang doesn't just simply convert prompts from one format to the other, when needed Convo-Lang will augment the capabilities of a model to add support for features like structured JSON data or tool calling. This truly gives you the ability to write a prompt once and use it with any LLM.

**LLAMA**

llama.convo

```convo
> define
__model='llama-3-3-70b'

> user
Tell me about what kind of AI model you are
<__send/>
```

**OpenAI**

open-ai.convo

```convo
> define
__model='gpt-5'

> user
Tell me about what kind of AI model you are
<__send/>
```

**Claude**

claude.convo

```convo
> define
__model='claude-3-7-sonnet'

> user
Tell me about what kind of AI model you are
<__send/>
```

**DeepSeek**

deepseek.convo

```convo
> define
__model='deepseek-r1'

> user
Tell me about what kind of AI model you are
<__send/>
```

### Ease of Readability

A defining attribute of Convo-Lang is it easy to read syntax. For basic prompts it is nothing more than plain English, but even when using features like tool calling Convo-Lang is clear and concise, allowing you to write structured and interactive AI agents without complex code.

To demonstrate the ease of readability of Convo-Lang we will take a look at the same prompt in both the OpenAI API standard and in Convo-Lang. The prompt instructs an agent to act as a funny dude and to always respond to the user with a joke and if the user likes a joke to call the likeJoke function.

### Convo-Lang version

Here is the Convo-Lang version, clean and easy to read:

submit-joke.convo

```convo
# Call when the user likes a joke
> likeJoke(

    # The joke the user liked
    joke:string

    # The reason they liked the joke
    reason?:string
) -> (
    httpPost("https://api.convo-lang.ai/mock/liked-jokes" __args)
)

> system
You are a funny dude. respond to all messages with a joke regardless of the situation.

If a user says that they like one of your jokes call the like Joke function

> assistant
Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts!

> user
LOL, I really like that one. It reminded my of The Adams Family.
<__send/>
```

### OpenAI version

And here is the same prompt using the OpenAI Standard, you can still read it but it's not pretty to look at.

On top of it being longer and harder to read it doesn't even include the actual API call to the jokes API, that would have to be done in Javascript or Python and require even more code for handling the tool call.

submit-joke-openai.json

```json
{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a funny dude. respond to all messages with a joke regardless of the situation.\n\nIf a user says that they like one of your jokes call the like Joke function"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Why don't skeletons fight each other?\n\nThey don't have the guts!"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "LOL, I really like that one. I love skeleton jokes"
        }
    ],
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "likeJoke",
                "description": "Call when the user likes a joke",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "required": [
                        "joke"
                    ],
                    "properties": {
                        "joke": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The joke the user liked"
                        },
                        "reason": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The reason they liked the joke"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can decide which version you prefer, but it's pretty obvious which one is easier to read. And as an added bonus the Convo-Lang version even handles making the HTTP request to submit the liked joke, this is completely out of the scope of the OpenAI standard and requires a non-trivial amount of additional code when not using Convo-Lang.

### Simplified Tool Use

Defining and using tools and functions is natural and easy to read and understand. Convo-Lang handles all of the coordination between the user and LLM when functions are called and allows functions to be defined directly in your prompt or externally in your language of choice.

Here is an example of a tool / function used to sendGreetings to a user's email and what it looks like when to tool is called:

_(note - the `> call` and `> result` messages are inserted by Convo-Lang when the LLM decides to use a tool or call a function)_

function-call-example.convo

```convo
# Sends a greeting to a given email
> sendGreeting(
    # Email to send greeting to
    to:string
    # Message of the greeting
    message:string
) -> (
    // __args is an object containing all arguments pass to the function
    httpPost("https://api.convo-lang.ai/mock/greeting" __args)
)

> user
Tell Greg welcome to the team and mention something about it being great to meet him. His email is greg@example.com

// This message is inserted by Convo-Lang after the LLM calls the sendGreeting function
@toolId call_wpyVtzKU8P5y2ZVJOGCo5Mke
> call sendGreeting(
    "to": "greg@example.com",
    "message": "Welcome to the team, Greg! It was great to meet you and we're excited to have you onboard."
)

// This message is inserted by Convo-Lang after the sendGreeting function is called
> result
__return={
    "to": "greg@example.com",
    "message": "Welcome to the team, Greg! It was great to meet you and we're excited to have you onboard.",
    "id": "ZwAAAHIAAABl"
}

> assistant
I've sent a welcome message to Greg at greg@example.com, letting him know it's great to have him on the team and that it was nice meeting him. If you want to add anything more or send another message, let me know!

> user
Can you send Holy a thank you message for leading the dev call yesterday. Her email is holly@example-builders.dev
<__send/>
```

### Flexible RAG Support

Quickly connect to RAG sources using pre-built Convo-Lang packages or write custom RAG service integrations for maximum extensibility.

```sh
npm i @convo-lang/convo-lang-pinecone
```

rag-example.convo

```convo
> define
enableRag("/public/movies")

> assistant
I'm pretty good at remembering movie quotes. Test my skills

> user
Life is like a box of ...
<__send/>
```

### Transparency and Auditability

Because all messages and interactions with LLMs—including RAG sources, tool calls, reasoning prompts, and more—are stored in plain text as a transactional log of the user’s entire interaction history, auditing and reviewing is significantly simplified.

_**Can you spot who is responsible for the break in company policy in the scenario below?**_

```convo
> define
// Setting __trackTime to true will include a timestamp of when a message was sent
__trackTime=true

projects={
    kUK3mH8q:{
        name:"Meadow Springs",
        status:"Waiting on material delivery",
        incompleteTasks:[
            "Install appliances"
            "Paint walls"
        ]
    }
    uLJ9jZJZ:{
        name:"Indigo Flats",
        status:"waiting for approval",
        incompleteTasks:[]
    }
}

```

### Custom Reasoning

By using Convo-Lang functions and inline-prompts you can define custom thinking / reasoning algorithms that work with any LLM and even mix different models in to the same chain of thought.

customer-support-chain-of-thought.convo

```convo
> define
SupportTicket=struct(
    type: enum("checkout" "product-return" "shipping" "other")
    message: string
    productName?: string
)

@on user
> customerSupport() -> (

    if(??? (+ !boolean /m)
        Does the user need customer assistants?
    ???) return()

    ??? (+ ticket=json:SupportTicket /m task:Generating Support Ticket)
        Generate a support ticket based on the user's needs
    ???

    submission=httpPost("https://api.convo-lang.ai/mock/support-request" ticket)

    ??? (+ respond /m task:Reviewing Support Ticket)
        Tell the user a new support ticket has been submitted and they can
        reference using id {{submission.id}}. Display the id in a fenced code block
        at the end of your response with the contents of "Support Ticket ID: {ID_HERE}".
    ???
)

> user
I can't add the Jackhawk 9000 to my cart. Every time I click the add to cart button the page freezes
<__send/>
```

### Prompt Ownership

Since Convo-Lang is can be stored as a plain text file you can truly own your prompts and agents and store them anywhere you wish. Unlike many other systems that store your agents "somewhere" in the cloud or spread across a sea of source code files and databases, the entirety of an agent written in Convo-Lang lives in Convo-Lang.

**This gives you the power and flexibility to do things like:**

*   Track agents with source control software (Git).
*   Share agents between platforms.
*   Edit agents in any software that supports plain text.
*   Send agents through software messaging software like Slack and WhatsApp.

### Python Integration

**Coming Soon**

## So How Does All This Work?

Convo-Lang is much more than just a pretty way to format prompts, it's a full programming language and runtime. At a high level, Convo-Lang scripts are executed on a client device and the output of the script is used to create prompts in the format of the LLM, then the converted prompt are sent to the LLM. This process of execution and conversion allows Convo-Lang to work with any LLM that an adaptor can be written for and allows Convo-Lang to add enhanced capabilities to an LLM without needed to make any changes to the model itself.

Convo-Lang execution flow:

![1. Parse Convo-Lang script. The parsed script results in a collection of message objects.
2. Load parsed messages objects into a Conversation context. The Conversation context contains message, variables, callbacks for tools and more.
3. Wait for user input or continue if explicitly instructed
4. Evaluate and flatten the messages of the conversation. When a message is flatten any dynamic expressions in the message are evaluated and the resulting flatten message is a static string.
5. Send flattened messages an LLM adapter. LLM adapters handle the sending of messages to an LLM in the format expected by the LLM.
6. LLM adapter converts flattened messages into the format required by its target LLM.
7. Messages are sent to the LLM.
8. LLM sends back a response.
9. The LLM adapter converts the response messages to a collection of ConvoCompletionMessage objects which is usable by the Conversation context.
10. The LLM adapter sends the ConvoCompletionMessage objects to the Conversation context.
11. The Conversation context appends the new messages to the conversation.
12. If no tool calls are required return to step 3 otherwise continue
13. Requested tool / function is invoked and its return value is appended to the conversation as a message. The actual code that gets ran can either be external code such as JavaScript or Python or can be Convo-Lang executional statements.
14. The return value message is sent to the LLM using an LLM adapter using steps 5 - 11.
15. The LLM returns a response message based on the return value message

Now that you have a good understanding of Convo-Lang and how it can be used, its time to start your journey with the language and learn its ways 🥷. The following Convo-Lang tutorial is full of interactive snippets. We encourage you to try them all, the best way to learn is to do.

## Conversation is key

At the heart of Convo-Lang are Conversations. A Conversation is a collection of messages. Messages can either contain textual content, multi-modal content or executable statements.

Conversations are managed by the Conversation Engine, which is a code interpreter that interpreters Convo scripts. It handles all of the complexities of sending messages between a user and an LLM, executing tool use / calling function and manages the internal state of a Conversation.

Convo scripts are conversations written in Convo-Lang and stored in a file or memory. When integrating Convo-Lang into an application you will often store Convo-Lang scripts in strings that are then passed to the Conversation Engine.

## Language Basics

Convo-Lang consists of a few simple building blocks, Content Message, Functions, Top Level Statements, Variables, Tags and Comments. By combining these building blocks Convo-Lang allows you to create interactive, multi-modal conversations between humans and LLMs. These conversations.

*   Content Message - Textual and multi-modal messages shared between humans and LLMs
*   Comments - There are 2 type of comments in Convo-Lang, Document Comment and Coding Comments
    *   Documenting Comments - Used to document functions and data structures for LLMs. Documenting Comments start with a (`#`) character .
    *   Coding Comments - Used to level comments about code or messages. LLMs are not aware of coding comments. Coding Comments start the (`//`)
*   Top Level Statements - Blocks of executable statements that can define variables, data structures and execute arbitrary code
*   Variables - Variables store well define state information in a conversation
*   Functions - Functions or "Tools" that can be used by LLMs or other code in a conversation
*   Tags - Used to attach metadata to messages, functions and statements

content-messages-example.convo

```convo
> system
This is a system message used to control the
behaviour of an LLM

> assistant
This is an assistant message sent from the LLM

> user
This is a user message sent form the user
```

comments-example.convo

```convo
// this is a coding comment and will not be visible to the LLM

# This is a documenting comment and will document the message or statement that follows it
```

top-level-statements-example.convo

```convo
> define
// We can define variables and data structures here
```

variables-example.convo

```convo
> define
// This is a variable named username
username="Max"

// We can now insert the username variable in the following message using a dynamic expression
> assistant
Hi, my name is {{username}}
```

functions-example.convo

```convo
// Below is a function an LLM can call. Functions can also define a body containing code statements.

# Opens a page of a PDF by page number
> gotoPage(
    # The page number to goto
    pageNumber:number
)
```

tags-example.convo

```convo
// The @suggestion tag displays a suggestions to the user
@suggestion
> assistant
This is a suggestion message
```

## Content Messages

Content message represent textual and multi-modal messages shared between an LLM and a user.

Below is an example of a clown telling a jokes to a user.

clown-joke.convo

```convo
> system
You are a funny clown name Bido telling jokes
to young kids. Respond to all messages with
a circus joke.

When you tell a joke first ask the user a question
in one message then deliver the punch line after
they respond.

> assistant
Hi, I'm Bido. I can tell you a joke about anything.

> user
I think cats secretly rule the world.

> assistant
Why did the circus lion eat a tightrope walker?

> user
I dont know

> assistant
Because he wanted a well-balanced meal!
```

This example used 3 different types of messages: `system`, `assistant` and `user` which are all content messages. The `system` message defines the behaviour of the LLM and is hidden from the user in the chat window, the `assistant` messages represent the message sent by the LLM and the `user` messages represent the message sent by the user.

### Dynamic Expressions

Content messages can also contain dynamic expressions. Dynamic expressions are small pieces of Convo-code surrounded in double curly brackets - `{{ add( 1 2) }}`

Below is an example of inserting the current date and time into a system message to allow the LLM to know what the date and time it is.

dynamic-content.convo

```convo
> assistant
Its {{dateTime()}} somewhere

> user
Yep, it's about that time
<__send/>
```

## Comments

There are 2 types of comments in Convo-Lang: documenting comments and non-documenting comments.

Documenting comments begin with the `#` character and continue to the end of the line the comment is written on. Documenting comments are relayed to the LLM and help inform the LLM. For example a documenting comment can be added to a function to instruct the LLM on how to use the function.

Non-documenting comments begin with `//` and also continue to the end of the line the comment is written on. Non-documenting comments are not relayed to the LLM and are meant to store developer comments

The following is an example of how documenting comments can help the LLM understand how to use a function even though the function and it's arguments are named poorly.

poorly-named-function.convo

```convo
# Places an online order for a pizza
> myFunction(

    # Name of the pizza to order
    arg1: string

    # Number of pizzas to order
    arg2: number
)

> user
Order 200 peperoni pizzas

@toolId call_kjFS4sxrL1lxdZ9V528bgTWY
> call myFunction(
    "arg1": "pepperoni",
    "arg2": 200
)
> result
__return={
    "arg1": "pepperoni",
    "arg2": 200
}

> assistant
I have placed an order for 200 pepperoni pizzas.

> user
Add 50 sausage and ham pizzas
<__send/>
```

As you can see, even though the function to order pizzas was named myFunction the LLM was able to call myFunction to order the pizzas since the documenting comments informed the LLM what the function is used for and what the arguments of the function are used for.

## Top Level Statement Messages

Top level statements are used to define variables, data structures and execute statements. There are 4 types of top level statement messages. In most cases you will use `define` or `do`.

*   `define` - Used to define variables and types. Code written in a define message have a limited set of functions they can call.
*   `do` - Used to define variables and execute statements.
*   `debug` - Used to write debug information. In most cases, you will not directly create debug messages.
*   `end` - Explicitly ends a message and can be used to set variables related to the ended message.

`define` and `do` both allow you to write Convo-code that is executed at runtime. The only difference between them is that `define` limits the types of functions that can be called and is intended to contain code that can be statically analyzed and has no side-effects at runtime.

Below is an example of creating an agent named Ricky. The `define` and `do` top level statements define variable that are inserted into content messages using dynamic expressions.

top-level-template.convo

```convo
> define

Hobby = struct(
    name: string
    annualBudget: number
)

name='Ricky'
age=38
profession='Race car driver'
action='Go Fast!'
aboutUrl='/example/ricky.md'
hobby=new(Hobby {
    name: "Deep sea diving"
    annualBudget: 30000
})

> do
about=httpGetString(aboutUrl)

> system
Your name is {{name}}. You are {{age}} years old
and you're a {{profession}}.

Use the following information to answers questions.
<about-you>
{{about}}
<about-you>

Your favorite hobby:
<favorite-hobby>
{{hobby}}
</favorite-hobby>

> assistant
Hi, my name is {{name}}. Are you ready to {{action}}

> user
I'm ready lets go 🏎️
<__send/>
```

As you can see the `define` message defines several variables about the persona we want the agent to have. We also defined a `struct` to describe the properties of a hobby. We will learn more about data structure later on. All of the code in the `define` message contains static values that will have no side-effects at runtime and will not change regardless of when and where the prompt is executed. In the `do` message we load a markdown file over HTTP and since the loading data over the network has non-deterministic behavior the `httpGetString` function must be called from within a `do` message.

## Variables

Variables allow you to store state information about a conversation in named variables and can be defined directly in Convo-Lang or injected from external sources. Using variables allows you to create prompt template and avoid purely relying on the memory of an LLM to keep track of important information. Variables must always start with a lowercase letter.

### Variable Types

Convo-Lang defines a set of built-in primitive types, strings, arrays, enums and custom data structures. Strings are enclosed in pairs of single or double quotes. Variables are dynamically typed so they can be assigned to any variable type at any time.

`string` - A series of characters enclosed in either single or double quotes. [read more](#strings)

`number` - Floating point number

`int` - Integer

`time` - Integer timestamp

`boolean` - Boolean or a true / value value

`any` - A type that can be assigned any value

`null` - Null constant

`undefined` - Undefined constant

`enum` - A restricted set of strings or numbers. [read more](#enums)

`array` - An array of values. [read more](#arrays)

`map` - An object with key value pairs

`struct` - A custom data structure. [read more](#structures)

Below is an example different variable types

all-the-variables.convo

```convo
> define

intVar=123
floatingPointVar=1.23

// now() returns the current date and 
// time as a timestamp
timeVar=now()

// booleans can be true or false
trueVar=true
falseVar=false

nullVar=null

undefinedVar=undefined

// The value of intVar will be inserted into
// the string at runtime
singleQVar='value - {{intVar}}'

// The value of intVar will not be inserted
doubleQVar="value - {{intVar}}"

// The array will have a value of 1, 2, true
arrayVar=array(1 2 intVar trueVar)

PetType=enum("cat" "dog" "fish" "bird")

Pet=struct(
    name:string
    type:PetType
    attributes:object
)

pet=new(Pet {
    name:"Mini"
    type:"bird"
    attributes:{
        color:'blue'
        age:6
    }
})

> assistant
intVar: {{intVar}}
floatingPointVar: {{floatingPointVar}}
timeVar: {{timeVar}}
trueVar: {{trueVar}}
falseVar: {{falseVar}}
nullVar: {{nullVar}}
undefinedVar: {{undefinedVar}}
singleQVar: {{singleQVar}}
doubleQVar: {{doubleQVar}}

arrayVar:
{{arrayVar}}

pet:
{{pet}}

```

### Variable Scope

Variables live either in the global scope of a conversation or in the local scope of a function. Variables define in global scope can be inserted into content messages using dynamic expressions.

variable-scope.convo

```convo
> define
// This variable is defined in global scope
storeLocation="Cincinnati"

> orderFood(food:string) -> (
    // food and order time are both defined in the 
    // local variable scope of the orderFood function.
    orderTime=dateTime()

    // Here we print out a summary of the order 
    // including the storeLocation which comes from
    // the global scope
    print('Order: time:{{orderTime}}] location:{{storeLocation}} - {{food}}')

    return('Success')
)

// The storeLocation variable is accessed from global 
// scope and inserted into the assistant message.
> assistant
Welcome to the {{storeLocation}} Crabby Patty

> user
I'll take a 2 Crabby patties
<__send/>
```

### Variable Assignment Order

Depending on where at in a conversation a variable is accessed it can have different values, this is because variable assignment only effects messages following the assignment.

assignment-order.convo

```convo
> define
bottleCount=99

> assistant
There are {{bottleCount}} bottles of beer on the
wall. Now take one down and pass it around.

> define
bottleCount=98

> assistant
There are {{bottleCount}} bottles of beer on the
wall. Now take one down and pass it around.

> define
bottleCount=97

> assistant
There are {{bottleCount}} bottles of beer on the
wall. I see a cycle of alcohol abuse forming.

```

As you can see each message says there is a different number of bottles of beer on the wall and this is because each message is only effected by the assignments the come before them.

**There is one exception** to the rules of variable assignment order. When a messages is tagged with the `@edge` tag it is considered an [Edge Message](#edge-messages). Edge messages are always evaluated at the end of a conversation. They are most often used to injected the most update value of variables into system messages. We will learn more about Edge Messages later in this tutorial.

### System Variables

System variables are used to control the configuration of a conversation at run time through variable assignment. All system variables start with a double underscore `__` and using a double underscore for user defined variables is prohibited.

`__cache` - Used to enabled prompt caching. A value of true will use the default prompt cached which by default uses the `ConvoLocalStorageCache`. If assigned a string a cache with a matching type will be used.

`__args` - A reference to the parameters passed the the current function as any object.

`__return` - A reference to the last return value of a function called by a call message

`__error` - A reference to the last error

`__cwd` - In environments that have access to the filesystem \_\_cwd defines the current working directory.

`__debug` - When set to true debugging information will be added to conversations.

`__model` - Sets the default model

`__endpoint` - Sets the default completion endpoint

`__userId` - Sets the default user id of the conversation

`__trackTime` - When set to true time tracking will be enabled.

`__trackTokenUsage` - When set to true token usage tracking will be enabled.

`__trackModel` - When set to true the model used as a completion provider will be tracked.

`__visionSystemMessage` - When defined \_\_visionSystemMessage will be injected into the system message of conversations with vision capabilities. \_\_visionSystemMessage will override the default vision system message.

`__visionServiceSystemMessage` - The default system message used for completing vision requests. Vision requests are typically completed in a separate conversation that supports vision messages. By default the system message of the conversation that triggered the vision request will be used.

`__defaultVisionResponse` - Response used with the system is not able to generate a vision response.

`__md` - A reference to markdown vars.

`__rag` - Enables retrieval augmented generation (RAG). The value of the \_\_rag can either be true, false or a number. The value indicates the number of rag results that should be sent to the LLM by default all rag message will be sent to the LLM. When setting the number of rag messages to a fixed number only the last N number of rag messages will be sent to the LLM. Setting \_\_rag to a fixed number can help to reduce prompt size.

`__ragParams` - object it is ignored.

`__ragTol` - The tolerance that determines if matched rag content should be included as contact.

`__sceneCtrl` - A reference to a SceneCtrl that is capable of describing the current user interface as a scene the user is viewing.

`__lastDescribedScene` - The last described scene added to the conversation

`__voice` - Used by agents to define their voice

## Functions

Function messages define functions ( also known as tools ) that LLMs can call at runtime. Function messages start with a `>` character followed by an optional modifier, identifier, 0 or more arguments and an optional function body. A function's body contains Convo-code the is executed by the Conversation Engine. If a function does not define a body it will return the arguments it is given as and object with key value paris matching the names an values of arguments passed.

Below is an example of an LLM using a `addNumbers` function to add numbers together.

add-numbers.convo

```convo
# Adds 2 numbers together
> addNumbers(
    a: number
    b: number
) -> (
    return( add( a b ) )
)

> user
What is 2 plus 2


@toolId call_eG2MksnUMczGCjoKsY8AMh0f
> call addNumbers(
    "a": 2,
    "b": 2
)
> result
__return=4


> assistant
2 plus 2 equals 4.

> user
Add 70 plus the number of plants in our solar system
<__send/>
```

After the user asked what 2 plus 2 is the LLM called the `addNumbers` function using a function `call` message. Function call messages define the name of a function to call and the arguments to pass to the function. After the addNumbers function is called its return value is written as a `result` message and stores the return value in the `__return` variable. Following the `result` message the LLM responds with a content message giving the result to the user in plain english.

### Extern Functions

Extern function allow you do define functions in other languages that are call by the the Conversation Engine This allows Convo-Lang to integrate into existing systems and offload complex logic to more traditional programming languages

Below is an example of an agent setting the color of an SVG shape based on input from the user

**Extern function written in javascript:**

set-shape-color.js

_@@export_

```js
export function setShapeColor(shape,color){
    const svgShape=document.querySelector(`#example-color-shapes .shape-${shape}`);
    if(svgShape){
        svgShape.setAttribute('fill',color);
        return 'Color set';
    }else{
        return 'Unable to find shape';
    }
}
```

shape.svg

```html
<svg id="example-color-shapes" width="300" height="100" viewBox="0 0 300 100">
    <circle class="shape-circle" cx="56.6176" cy="50" r="35" fill="red"/>
    <path class="shape-triangle" d="M144 17L182 82H107L144 17Z" fill="blue"/>
    <rect class="shape-square" x="208.382" y="17.4706" width="70" height="70" fill="green"/>
</svg>
```

preview-shape.svg

_@@render_

```html
<svg id="example-color-shapes" width="300" height="100" viewBox="0 0 300 100">
    <circle class="shape-circle" cx="56.6176" cy="50" r="35" fill="red"/>
    <path class="shape-triangle" d="M144 17L182 82H107L144 17Z" fill="orange"/>
    <rect class="shape-square" x="208.382" y="17.4706" width="70" height="70" fill="green"/>
</svg>
```

edit-shapes.convo

```convo
# Sets the color of a shape
> extern setShapeColor(

    # The shape to set the color of
    shape:enum( "circle" "triangle" "square" )

    # A hex color to set the shape to
    color:string;
)

> user
Change the color of the triangle to orange

@toolId call_vWZpLFZr2IiHWE30deg4ckGw
> call setShapeColor(
    "shape": "triangle"
    "color": "orange"
)
> result
__return="Color set"


> assistant
The color of the triangle has been set to orange

> user
Now change the square to blue
<__send/>
```

## Tags

Tags are used in many ways in Convo-Lang and serve as a way to add metadata to messages and code statements. Tags on the line just before the message or code statement they are tagging. Tags start with the `@` character followed by the name of the tag and optionally a value for the tag separated from it's name with a space character - `@tagName tagValue`.

The following show the use of several different tags and describes their usage.

tags.convo

```convo
> assistant
Ask me a question

// @concat appends the content of the follow 
// message to the previous
@concat
> assistant
Any question, I dare ya.

// @suggestion display a message as a
// clickable suggestion
@suggestion
> assistant
What is your favorite ice cream

@suggestion
> assistant
how much wood can a woodchuck chuck

// @json instructs the LLM to response with JSON
@json
> user
How many planets are there in the solar system

// @format indicates the response format 
// of the message
@format json
> assistant
{
    "number_of_planets": 8,
    "planets": [
        "Mercury",
        "Venus",
        "Earth",
        "Mars",
        "Jupiter",
        "Saturn",
        "Uranus",
        "Neptune"
    ]
}
```

### System Tags

Below is a full list of system tags Convo-Lang uses.

`@import` - Allows you to import external convo-lang scripts. [read more](#imports)

`@cache` - Enables caching for the message the tag is applied to. No value of a value of true will use the default prompt cached which by default uses the `ConvoLocalStorageCache`. If assigned a string a cache with a matching type will be used.

`@clear` - Clears all content messages that precede the messages with the exception of system messages. If the value of "system" is given as the tags value system message will also be cleared.

`@noClear` - Prevents a message from being clear when followed by a message with a `@clear` tag applied.

`@disableAutoComplete` - When applied to a function the return value of the function will not be used to generate a new assistant message.

`@edge` Used to indicate that a message should be evaluated at the edge of a conversation with the latest state. @edge is most commonly used with system message to ensure that all injected values are updated with the latest state of the conversation.

`@time` - Used to track the time messages are created.

`@tokenUsage` - Used to track the number of tokens a message used

`@model` - Used to track the model used to generate completions

`@responseModel` - Sets the requested model to complete a message with

`@endpoint` - Used to track the endpoint to generate completions

`@responseEndpoint` - Sets the requested endpoint to complete a message with

`@responseFormat` - Sets the format as message should be responded to with.

`@assign` - Causes the response of the tagged message to be assigned to a variable

`@json` - When used with a message the json tag is short and for `@responseFormat json`

`@format` - The format of a message

`@assignTo` - Used to assign the content or jsonValue of a message to a variable

`@capability` - Used to enable capabilities. The capability tag can only be used on the first message of the conversation if used on any other message it is ignored. Multiple capability tags can be applied to a message and multiple capabilities can be specified by separating them with a comma.

`@enableVision` - Shorthand for `@capability vision`

`@task` - Sets the task a message is part of. By default messages are part of the "default" task

`@maxTaskMessageCount` - Sets the max number of non-system messages that should be included in a task completion

`@taskTrigger` - Defines what triggers a task

`@template` - Defines a message as a template

`@sourceTemplate` - used to track the name of templates used to generate messages

`@component` - Used to mark a message as a component. The value can be "render" or "input". The default value is "render" if no value is given. When the "input" value is used the rendered component will take input from a user then write the input received to the executing conversation. [read more](#components)

`@renderOnly` - When applied to a message the message should be rendered but not sent to LLMs

`@condition` - When applied to a message the message is conditionally added to the flattened view of a conversation. When the condition is false the message will not be visible to the user or the LLM. [read more](#conditional-messages)

`@renderTarget` - Controls where a message is rendered. By default messages are rendered in the default chat view, but applications can define different render targets.

`@toolId` - Used in combination with function calls to mark to return value of a function and its call message

`@disableAutoScroll` - When applied to the last content or component messages auto scrolling will be disabled

`@markdown` - When applied to a message the content of the message will be parsed as markdown

`@sourceUrl` - A URL to the source of the message. Typically used with RAG.

`@sourceId` - The ID of the source content of the message. Typically used with RAG.

`@sourceName` - The name of the source content of the message. Typically used with RAG.

`@suggestion` - When applied to a message the message becomes a clickable suggestion that when clicked will add a new user message with the content of the message. If the suggestion tag defines a value that value will be displayed on the clickable button instead of the message content but the message content will still be used as the user messaged added to the conversation when clicked. Suggestion message are render only and not seen by LLMs.

`@suggestionTitle` - A title display above a group of suggestions

`@output` - Used to mark a function as a node output.

`@errorCallback` - Used to mark a function as an error callback

`@concat` - Causes a message to be concatenated with the previous message. Both the message the tag is attached to and the previous message must be content messages or the tag is ignored. When a message is concatenated to another message all other tags except the condition tag are ignored.

`@call` - Instructs the LLM to call the specified function. The values "none", "required", "auto" have a special meaning. If no name is given the special "required" value is used.

*   none: tells the LLM to not call any functions
*   required: tells the LLM it must call a function, any function.
*   auto: tells the LLM it can call a function respond with a text response. This is the default behaviour.

`@eval` - Causes the message to be evaluated as code. The code should be contained in a markdown code block.

`@userId` - Id of the user that created the message

`@preSpace` - Causes all white space in a content message to be preserved. By define all content message whitespace is preserved.

`@init` - When applied to a user message and the message is the last message in a conversation the message is considered a conversation initializer.

`@transform` - Adds a message to a transform group. Transform groups are used to transform assistant output. The transform tags value can be the name of a type or empty. Transform groups are ran after all text responses from the assistant. Transform messages are not added to the flattened conversation.

`@transformGroup` - Sets the name of the transform group a message will be added to when the transform tag is used.

`@transformHideSource` - If present on a transform message the source message processed will be hidden from the user but still visible to the LLM

`@transformKeepSource` - Overrides `transformHideSource` and `transformRemoveSource`

`@transformRemoveSource` - If present on a transform message the source message processed will not be added to the conversation

`@transformRenderOnly` - If present the transformed message has the `renderOnly` tag applied to it causing it to be visible to the user but not the LLM.

`@transformComponentCondition` - A transform condition that will control if the component tag can be passed to the created message

`@transformTag` - Messages created by the transform will include the defined tag

`@transformComponent` - A shortcut tag combines the `transform`, `transformTag`, `transformRenderOnly`, `transformComponentCondition` and `transformHideSource` tags to create a transform that renders a component based on the data structure of a named struct.

`@createdByTransform` - Applied to messages created by a transform

`@includeInTransforms` - When applied to a message the message will be included in all transform prompts. It is common to apply includeInTransforms to system messages

`@transformDescription` - Describes what the result of the transform is

`@transformRequired` - If applied to a transform message it will not be passed through a filter prompt

`@transformFilter` - When applied to a message the transform filter will be used to select which transforms to to select. The default filter will list all transform groups and their descriptions to select the best fitting transform for the assistants response

`@transformOptional` - If applied to a transform message the transform must be explicitly enabled applying the `enableTransform` tag to another message or calling the enableTransform function.

`@overwrittenByTransform` - Applied to transform output messages when overwritten by a transform with a higher priority

`@enableTransform` - Explicitly enables a transform. Transforms are enabled by default unless the transform has the `transformOptional` tag applied.

`@renderer` - Defines a component to render a function result

## Imports

Imports allow external Convo-Lang sources to be imported into the current conversation. Imports can be used to import libraries of functions, agent personas, knowledge sources, etc.

Imports are defined using the `@import` tag followed by the name or location of the source to import and optional modifiers.

Import sources can be http endpoints or local file paths

The following example includes 3 Convo scripts:

*   weather-agent.convo which is will be imported over http and defines a function for the agent to get the current weather
*   beach-boy.convo: Contains persona information about the user
*   weather-at-the-beach.convo: The main Convo script that imports the first 2

\[:https://learn.convo-lang.ai/example/weather-agent.convo:\]

```convo
// source name = weather-agent
> system
You are a friendly weather forecaster.
Always base your answers off of the weather

# Gets the current weather conditions for the given
# location. Returned values use the metric system.
> getWeather(
    city:string
    state:string
) -> (
    weather=httpGet(
        "https://6tnpcnzjbtwa5z4qorusxrfaqu0sqqhs.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/",

The weather in Miami today is mostly cloudy with a temperature of about 24°C (75°F). There is no chance of rain and mild winds at a speed of 3.5 m/s.

Given the conditions, here are some activities you might enjoy today:

1. **Surfing**: Since there is no rain and the wind is not too strong, it could be a great day to hit the waves.

2. **Roller Blading**: With a nice temperature and cloudy skies, it's also a good opportunity for roller blading along Miami's scenic paths.

3. **Puzzles at Home**: If you prefer staying indoors, maybe a relaxing day of puzzles would be a perfect way to enjoy the clouds without worrying about rain.

Enjoy your day!

## RAG

Retrieval augmented generation or RAG is a key part of any serious AI application, but it can be complicated to implement correctly. Convo-Lang provides an easy to use interface to connect a conversation to any RAG source.

**How does RAG work in Convo-Lang**

1.  A user sends a message
2.  Registered RAG providers are forwarded the user's message
3.  The RAG providers preforms the task of retrieving information related to the user's message. In the case of this website Pinecone is used.
4.  The RAG callback returns the related information
5.  Convo-Lang then appends the related information to the user's message and optionally encloses the information in a prefix and suffix

**The following example enables RAG using a vector store containing movie quotes.**

rag.convo

```convo
// The @rag tag enables RAG search on the public movies index
@rag public/movies

> system
You are a movie enthusiast resiting quotes from movies the user is talking about.
Respond with a funny replay based on the content in the RAG xml tags. The tags can not be
seen by the user.

// This message will be used as a template to insert rag content into the user message.
// $$RAG$$ will be replaced with the actual retrieved content.
> ragTemplate
<RAG>
Movie Quotes:

$$RAG$$
</RAG>

## Vision

Vision capabilities are enabled in Convo-Lang using markdown style images. Markdown images are converted into the native format of LLM at runtime.

vision.convo

```convo
> user
What percent of the green energy mix come
from Biomass in this image
![image](https://app.convo-lang.ai/example/green-energy.png)
```

## JSON Mode

It is often very useful for for you to have an LLM return responses as properly formatted JSON. JSON mode is enabled using the `@json`.

json-mode.convo

```convo
@json
> user
What is the population and land area of the 2
largest states in America by GDP?

@format json
> assistant
{
    "California": {
        "population": 39538223,
        "land_area": 163696,
        "units": "square_miles"
    },
    "Texas": {
        "population": 29145505,
        "land_area": 268596,
        "units": "square_miles"
    }
}
```

Here we can see the LLM returned a JSON object with California and Texas and included a `@format` tag with a value of json, indicating properly formatted JSON was returned.

You can also provide the name of a data structure as the value of a `@json` tag. When provided the returned JSON will conform to the given structure.

planets.convo

```convo
> define
Planet = struct(
    name:string
    diameterInMiles:number
    distanceFromSun:number
    numberOfMoons:number
)

@json Planet
> user
What is the biggest planet in our solar system



@format json
> assistant
{
    "name": "Jupiter",
    "diameterInMiles": 86881,
    "distanceFromSun": 484000000,
    "numberOfMoons": 79
}
```

## Message Transformers

Message transforms allow content returned by an LLM to be transformed into structured data and optionally have that structured data rendered by custom component when using the `ConversationView`.

**Transformer Steps**

1.  A prompt is evaluated to determine the most fitting transformer to use or if a transformer should be used at all.
    
2.  If a transformer is found to be a good fit for the returned LLM content the transformer is ran and the content is transformed into the target type of the transformer
    
3.  If the transformer specifies a render component the transformed data will be rendered as a custom component
    

Transformers are defined using tags

## Caching

**(Documentation coming soon)**

## Message Queuing

**(Documentation coming soon)**

## Parallel

Parallel message execution allows multiple messages to be completed at the same time. This is useful when you need to generated multiple responses within the same conversation and you want to reduce the time it takes to get back all of the responses.

_(note - Chat based interfaces are not the intended use case on parallel messages. Below is just a demonstration)_ **Press the send button in the chat window to complete all messages at once**

parallel.convo

```convo
> addNumbers(a:number b:number) -> (add(a b))

> parallel

@call
> user
Add 1 plus {{'3'}}

> user
Tell me a joke about cats

> user
Tell me a joke about birds

@call
> user
Add 55 plus {{'45'}}
```

## Stats Tracking

Using `__trackTime`, `__trackTokenUsage`, and `__trackModel` you can enable in-conversation stats that are written to the conversation as tags

stats.convo

```convo
> define
__trackTime=true
__trackTokenUsage=true
__trackModel=true

> user
Write a short poem about tree frogs eating fly when
all they want is some cheesecake.


@time 2024-10-26T00:43:09-04:00
@tokenUsage 24 / 188 / $0.00294
@model gpt-4o
> assistant
In the moonlit grove where the shadows dance,  
Tree frogs gather with a hopeful glance.  
Their eyes on the flies that circle the night,  
Yet dreams of cheesecake fill their hearts with light.  

Tiny tongues flick with a whispering snap,  
Catching their prey in a rhythmic trap.  
Yet in their minds, visions sweetly take shape,  
Of creamy delights beneath fruit's draped cape.  

“Alas,” they sigh, “we must feast on the fly,  
When caramel swirls could lift us so high.”  
But hope lingers still, like the dewdrop’s gleam,  
For one day, perhaps, they’ll taste that dream.  

So with the night, they’ll sing their sweet song,  
Wishing for cheesecake as the stars hum along.  
In the heart of the forest, under celestial streak,  
Tree frogs dream of flavors they long to seek.
```

## Advanced Messaging

You can use the following advanced messaging techniques to create highly dynamic messages that allow a conversation to be transformed based on the state of the conversation.

### Conditional Messages

The `@condition` tag is used to conditionally include messages in a conversation based on the value the condition expression. In most cases you will want to pair the `@condition` tag with the `@edge` tag so that the expression value is based on the latest state of the conversation.

conditional-messages.convo

```convo
> define
characterType='goodGuy'

@edge
@condition = eq(characterType "goodGuy")
> system
You are the hero in a super hero movie. Always be
positive and try to help the user.
Response with a single sentence

@edge
@condition = eq(characterType "badGuy")
> system
You are the villain in a super hero movie.
Alway be negative and bully the user.
Respond with a single sentence and always start
the sentence with "Heheh...,"


> user
My kitten is stuck in a tree

// The assistant responds as a good guy because
// characterType equals 'goodGuy'
> assistant
Hang tight, I'll use my superpowers to rescue your
kitten from the tree safely!



> user
Change to the bad guy

@toolId call_PzFYNKPIiNSG8cXysrZSS0xJ
> call changeCharacterType(
    "type": "badGuy"
)
> result
characterType="badGuy"
__return="badGuy"


> assistant
Even as a bad guy, I can't resist the urge to help
you out with your kitten!


> user
I can't hold on to my ballon because I'm a
little kid, helpp!!!

// The assistant responds as a bad guy because
// characterType equals 'badGuy'
> assistant
Heheh..., well, I suppose I could let it float away...
but where's the fun in that? I'll snag it back for
you this time. Catch!  🎈
```

### Edge Messages

An edge message is a message that is evaluated at the end or "edge" of a conversation. Typically variable assignment and other state changes have no effect the messages that follow them, but this is not the case with edge messages. Edge messages are evaluated after all variable assignment and state changes are complete regardless of the where the message is defined in a conversation. The `@edge` tag is used to mark messages as edge messages.

edge-messages.convo

```convo
> define
bankBalance=100

// This message will always show the starting balance
// of $100 regardless of any following assignments
// to bankBalance 
> assistant
Your starting bank balance is ${{bankBalance}}

// This message will alway show to the last value
// assigned to bankBalance since it is an edge message
@edge
> assistant
Your current bank balance is ${{bankBalance}}

# After making a deposit respond by only
# saying "Deposit complete"
> depositMoney(
    amount:number
) -> (
    bankBalance = add(bankBalance amount)
)

> user
Deposit 500 smackeroonies

@toolId call_Gqc7oXcXD2nFjKIDnLe6gaNz
> call depositMoney(
    "amount": 500
)
> result
bankBalance=600
__return=600


> assistant
Deposit complete
```

### Message Concatenation

Messages can be concatenated or joined together using the `@concat` tag. The concat tag is often used with conditional messages to make larger messages containing conditionally rendered sections.

Try changing the name variable to "Matt" to see what happens.

concat-messages.convo

```convo
> define
name="Bob"
> assistant
Hi, how are you today?

@concat
@condition = eq(name "Matt")
> assistant
My name is Matt and I like watching paint dry 😐

@concat
@condition = eq(name "Bob")
> assistant
My name is Bob and I like long walks do the isles
of my local Home Depot 👷🏼‍♂️

```

## Message Triggers

Message triggers allow the execution of functions when after appending new messages to a conversation. The `@on` tag is used to mark a function as a message trigger. Message triggers can be combined with inline prompting to create custom thinking models.

## Inline Prompts

Inline prompts are used to evaluate prompts inside of functions. Inline prompts start and end with triple questions marks `???` and can optionally include a header that define modifiers that control the behaviour of the inline prompt. Headers are defined directly after the opening `???` and are enclosed in a set of parentheses.

Inline prompts can define messages using the same syntax to define regular messages in Convo-Lang but can also omit using message role and have a message role picked automatically.

inline-prompt-example.convo

```convo
@on user
> inlineExample() -> (

    // Any todo items the user mentioned will be assigned to the todoItems variable
    ??? (+ todoItems=json:Todo[] /m)
        Extract any todo items the user mentioned
    ???

    // The same prompt as above but only using the continue modifier
    ??? (+)
        @json Todo
        > suffix
        <moderator>
        Extract any todo items the user mentioned
        </moderator>
    ???
)

> user
I need to learn Convo-Lang

> thinkingResult
todoItems=[{
    name:"Learn Convo-Lang",
    status:"in-progress"
}]

```

### Extend Modifier

`*` - Extends a conversation by including all user and assistant messages of the current conversation. After the prompt is executed it is added the the message stack of the current scope.

SourceInline ExpandedInline LLM View

Source before calling the checkForOpenRequest function

extend-source.convo

```convo
> user
Can you open the account settings?

@on user
> checkForOpenRequest() -> (
    ??? (*)
    <moderator>
    Did the user ask to open a page?
    </moderator>
    ???
)
```

The full inline prompt after applying all modifiers. The content includes the user message from the parent conversation of the inline prompt.

extend-inline-expanded.convo

```convo
> user
Can you open the account settings?

> suffix
<moderator>
Did the user ask to open a page?

extend-inline-llm-view.convo

```convo
> user
Can you open the account settings?

<moderator>
Did the user ask to open a page?
</moderator>
```

### Continue Modifier

`+` - Similar to extending a conversation but also includes any other extended or continued prompts in the current function that have been executed.

SourceInline ExpandedInline LLM View

Source before calling the checkForOpenRequest function

continue-source.convo

```convo
> user
Can you open the account settings?

> checkForOpenRequest() -> (
    ??? (+)
    <moderator>
    Did the user ask to open a page?
    </moderator>
    ???

    ??? (+)
    <moderator>
    Open the page and give the user a suggestion for what to do on the page
    </moderator>
    ???
)


```

The full content of the last inline prompt after applying all modifiers. The content includes the user message from the parent conversation and the content of the previous inline prompt.

(note - Messages with the `suffix` role only merge with user messages. If an assistant message precedes a suffix message the suffix message will be converted to a user message when flattened)

continue-inline-expanded.convo

```convo
> user
Can you open the account settings?

> suffix
<moderator>
Did the user ask to open a page?
</moderator>


> assistant
Yes the user ask to open the account settings page

> suffix
<moderator>
Open the page and give the user a suggestion for what to do on the page
</moderator>
```

Content of the inline prompt as it seen by the LLM.

continue-inline-llm-view.convo

```convo
> user
Can you open the account settings?

<moderator>

</moderator>

> assistant
Yes the user ask to open the account settings page

> user
<moderator>
Open the page and give the user a suggestion for what to do on the page
</moderator>
```

### Tag Modifier

`/{tag}` - Wraps the content of the prompt in an XML tag. The value after the slash is used as the name of the tag. In most cases tags are used in combination with the `*` or `+` modifiers.

SourceInline Expanded

Source before calling startClass

tag-source.convo

```convo
> user
Hello class
> startClass() -> (
    ??? (/teacher)
    Please open your book to page 10
    ???
)
```

tag-inline.convo

```convo
> prompt
<teacher>
Please open your book to page 10
</teacher>
```

### Moderator Tag Modifier

`/m` - Wraps the content of the prompt in the moderator XML tag adds the `moderatorTags` system message. Moderator tags are used to denote text as coming from a moderator in contrast to coming from the user.

SourceInline ExpandedInline LLM View

moderator-tag-source.convo

```convo
> user
I'm running late. When does my flight leave

> updateFlight() -> (
    ??? (+ /m)
    Does the user need to modify their flight?
    ???
)

```

The full content of the inline prompt after applying all modifiers. The content of the prompt has been wrapped in the `<modifier>` tag and a system message has been added explaining how the LLM should interpret `<modifier>` tags.

<moderator>
Does the user need to modify their flight?
</moderator>
```

### User Tag Modifier

`/u` - Wraps the content of the prompt in the `<user>` tag adds the `userTags` system message. The user tag modifier functions similar to the moderator modifier tag but indicates messages are coming from the user. In most cases the user modifier tag is not needed

### Assistant Tag Modifier

`/a` - Wraps the content of the prompt in the `<assistant>` tag adds the `assistantTags` system message. The assistant tag modifier functions similar to the moderator modifier tag but indicates messages are coming from the assistant. In most cases the assistant modifier tag is not needed

### Replace Modifier

`replace` - Replaces the content of the last user message with the response of the inline prompt. The replace modifier is commonly used with message triggers and uses the replace message role to modifier user messages.

### Task Modifier

`task:{description}` - Provides a description of what the inline prompt is doing and displays the description in the UI. The task modifier must be defined as the last modifier in the header. All content in the header after the task modifier is included in the description of the task modifier.

## Static Inline Prompts

Static inline prompts begin and end with triple equal symbols `===` and are similar to Inline Prompts but instead of being evaluated by an LLM the content of the prompt is returned directly. All of the inline prompt modifiers apply to static inline prompts.

static-inline-prompt.convo

```convo
> example() -> (
    === (quoteOfTheDay=)
    “I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right.”
    ===
)

```

## Specialized Thinking Model Example

Using Inline Prompts and Message Triggers you can implement specialized thinking algorithms using any LLM and even mix models using more specialized LLMs for specific tasks.

This example interviews the user based on a list of topics and dive into each topic

interview-agent.convo

```convo

> define
Answer=struct(
    topic:enum('location' 'hobby' 'personality')
    question:string
    # The user answer from perspective of the moderator
    answer:string
)

answers=[]
interviewDone=false
interviewSummary=null



@condition = not(interviewDone)
@edge
> system
You are interviewing a user on several topics. Only ask the user one question at a time

@condition = interviewDone
@edge
> system
You are having an open friendly conversation with the user.
Tell the user about what you think of their answers. Try not to asking too many questions, you
are now giving your option.


@edge

    summary:string
) -> (
    interviewSummary=summary
    interviewDone=true
    ===
        The interview is complete. Tell the user thank you for their time then complement them on
        one of the topics and ask a question about one of their answers to start a side bar conversation.
        Act very interested in the user.
    ===
)


@on user = not(interviewDone)

        ???

        answers = aryAdd(answers answer)

        switch(
            ??? (+ boolean /m task:Reviewing)
                Has the user given enough detail about the topic of {{answer.topic}} for you to have a
                full understanding of their relation with the topic? The user should have answered at least
                3 questions about the topic.
            ???

            === (suffix /m)
                Move on to the next topic
            ===

                Dive deeper into the users last answer by asking them a related question
            ===
        )
    ) else (

        switch(

            ??? (+ boolean /m task:Reviewing)
                Have all topics been completed?
            ???

            === (suffix /m)
                The interview is finished
            ===

            === (suffix /m)
                Continue the interview
            ===

        )

## Executable Statements

Statements in Convo-Lang refers to the executable code that is evaluated by the Conversation engine at runtime. Statements can be contained in function bodies, top level statement message and in dynamic expression embedded in content messages.

executable-statements

```convo
// all content in the define message are statements
> define
name="Jeff"
ageInDays=mul(38 365)

// The changeName function body contains 2 statements
> changeName(newName:string) -> (
    name=newName
    print('name set to {{newName}}')
)

// The assistant message contains 2 dynamic
// expressions containing statements
@edge
> assistant
Hi, I'm {{name}} I'm {{div(ageInDays 365)}} years old

```

### Strings

There are 4 types of string in convo.

#### ( " ) Double Quote

Double quote strings are the simplest strings in convo, they start and end with a double quote character. To include a double quote character in a double quote string escape it with a back slash. Double quote strings can span multiple lines.

double-quote-string.convo

```convo
> define
var1="Double quote string"
var2="Double quote string with a (\") double quote character"
var3="String with a newline
in it"

> assistant
var1: {{var1}}

var2: {{var2}}

var3: {{var3}}
```

#### ( ' ) Single Quote

Single quote strings are similar to double quotes but also support embedded statements. Embedded statements are surrounded with double curly bracket pairs and contain any valid convo statement

single-quote-strings

```convo
> define
name="Ricky Bobby"
var0='I need to tell you something {{name}}... You can walk.'

var1='Single quote string'
var2='Single quote string with a (\') single quote character'
var3='String with a newline
in it'

> assistant
var1: {{var1}}

var2: {{var2}}

var3: {{var3}}
```

#### Heredoc

Heredoc strings begin and end with 3 dashes and the contents of the string are highlighted with the convo-lang syntax highlighter. They are useful when defining strings with conversation messages in them.

heredoc.convo

```convo
> define
var1=---
Here is a heredoc string with an conversation in it

> user
Tell me a joke about airplanes

> assistant
Why don't airlines ever play hide and seek?

Because good luck hiding a plane!
---

> assistant
var1: {{var1}}
```

### Arrays

Arrays allow you to story multiple value in a single variable. Arrays can be created using the array function or using JSON style array, both result in the same data type.

arrays.convo

```convo
> define
// Create array using array function
ary1=array(1 2 3)

// Create JSON style array
ary2=[4 5 6]

Cart=struct(
    // here array is used to define an array type
    items:array(string)
)

cart=new(Cart {
    items:["drill" "bed"]
})

> assistant
ary1:
{{ary1}}

ary2:
{{ary2}}

cart:
{{cart}}
```

### Enums

Enums allow you to define a type that can only be a value from a pre-define collection of values. Using enums with functions allows you to restrict an LLM to only passing the exact values you want for an argument.

enums.convo

```convo
> define
// This is a named enum
ShirtSize=enum("xs" "sm" "md" "lg" "xl")

// The LLM will only call setShirtProperties with
// one of the values defined by the ShirtSize enum
> setShirtProperties(
    size:ShirtSize
    
    // You can also define enums inline with
    // function arguments
    color:enum("red" "green" "blue")
)

> user
I wear large shirt shirts and I love the color
green


@toolId call_pGfrCTSN4ozT2huwSBzkhTRp
> call setShirtProperties(
    "size": "lg",
    "color": "green"
)
> result
__return={
    "size": "lg",
    "color": "green"
}

> assistant
I've set your shirt size to large and the color to green. Enjoy your new shirt!

> user
```

### Structures

Structures allow you to define custom data types made up of a collection of typed properties. Named structures must always start with a capital letter. The properties of a structure can either be optional or required. Optional properties use a question mark after their name and before the colon used to denote the properties type. Properties of a structure can be documented using documenting comments to help describe the structure to LLMs.

New instances of a structure can be created using the `new` function. The new function takes the structure type as its first argument and an object that conforms to the structure as its second argument.

structs.convo

```convo
> define
Car=struct(
    name:string
    color:string
    transmission:enum("manual" "automatic")
    fuel:enum("gas" "diesel" "electric" "hybrid")
    make:string
    model:string
    year:int
    price:number
    // notes is an optional property
    notes?:string;
    features:array(string)

    // engine is an unnamed struct
    engine:struct(
        displacement:number
        maxRpm:int
        torque:number
    )
)

> buildCar(car:Car) -> (
    return('built')
)

> user
Build me a car that could win the Indy 500


> assistant
Building a car for the Indy 500 involves adhering to strict specifications set by the racing league. Below are some key characteristics that should be considered for an Indy 500 race car:

1. **Engine:** A twin-turbocharged V6 engine with a displacement of 2.2 liters is typical.
2. **Chassis:** The car must use a Dallara chassis, specifically designed for IndyCar racing.
3. **Transmission:** A semi-automatic transmission with paddle shifters, typically 6-speed, is preferred.
4. **Fuel:** High-performance racing fuel is used.
5. **Aerodynamics:** Must have advanced aerodynamic features, including adjustable wings and underbody designs that maximize downforce and minimize drag.
6. **Weight:** The car must meet specific weight standards, usually around 1,650 lbs (748 kg) including the driver.
7. **Safety:** Advanced safety features including the halo device, crash structures, and energy-absorbing materials.

Building a car with these specifications involves collaboration with specialized manufacturers and engineers, and is beyond the capabilities of standard systems. If you have specific features or areas you would like to focus on, please let me know!

Used internally to implement JSON object syntax support. At compile time JSON objects are converted to standard convo function calls.

function-json-map.convo

```convo
> do
jsonStyle = {
    "go": "fast",
    "turn": "left",
    "times" 1000
}

convoStyle = obj1 = jsonMap(
    go: "fast"
    turn: "left"
    times: 1000
)
```

#### jsonArray( ...properties: any )

Used internally to implement JSON array syntax support. At compile time JSON arrays are converted to standard convo function calls.

function-json-array.convo

```convo
> do
jsonStyle = [ 1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c" ]

convoStyle = array( 1 2 3 "a" "b" "c" )
```

### Math Operators

#### add( ...values:any )

Adds all arguments together and returns the result. Strings are concatenated. (a + b )

#### sub( a:number b:number )

Subtracts a from b and returns the result. (a - b )

#### sub( a:number b:number )

Multiplies a and b and returns the result. (a \* b )

#### div( a:number b:number )

Divides a and b and returns the result. (a / b )

#### pow( a:number b:number )

Raises a by b and returns the result. Math.pow(a, b )

#### inc( \*a:number byValue?:number )

Increments the value of the given variable by 1 or the value of the second argument. ( a++ ) or ( a+= byValue )

#### dec( \*a:number byValue?:number )

Decrements the value of the given variable by 1 or the value of the second argument. ( a-- ) or ( a-= byValue )

### Logic Operators

#### and( ...values: any )

Returns true if all given arguments are truthy.

function-and.convo

```convo
> do
// true
and( 1 )

// false
and( 0 )

// false
or( 1 2 )

// false
or( 0 1 )

// true
or( 0 false )

// false
or( eq(1 1))

// true
or( eq(1 2) )

```

#### gt( a:number b:number)

#### lt( a:number b:number)

Returns true if a is less then b. ( a < b )

#### lte( a:number b:number)

Returns true if a is less then or equal to b. ( a <= b )

### Control Flow

#### if( condition:any ), elif( condition: any ), then( ...statements )

If condition is truthy then the statement directly after the if statement will be executed otherwise the statement directly after if is skipped

function-if.convo

```convo
> do
age = 36
message=''

if( gte( age 21 ) ) then (
    message = "You can buy beer in the US"
) elif (lt( age 16 )) then(
    message = "You're not even close"
) else (
    message = '{{sub(21 age)}} years until you can buy beer in the US'
)

> assistant
{{message}}

```

#### while( condition:any )

While condition is truthy then the statement directly after the while statement will be executed otherwise the statement directly after if is skipped and the while loop will exit.

function-while.convo

```convo
> do
lap = 0

while( lt( lap 30 ) ) do (
    print("go fast")
    print("turn left")

    // increment by 1
    lap = inc(lap)
)

> assistant
lap = {{lap}}
```

#### foreach( iterator:any )

Executes the next statement for each item returned by the passed in iterator.

function-foreach.convo

```convo
> do
total = 0
foreach( num=in(array(1 2 3 4 )) ) do (
    total = add( num total )
)

> assistant
total = {{total}}
```

#### in( value: array(any) )

Iterates of the values of an array

#### break( ...values: any )

Breaks out of loops either not arguments are passed or if any of the passed arguments are truthy

function-break.convo

```convo
> do
lap = 0

while( true ) do (
    print("go fast")
    print("turn left")

    // increment by 1
    lap = inc(lap)

    if( eq( lap 30 ) ) then (
        break()
    )
)

> assistant
lap = {{lap}}
```

#### do( ...statements: any)

Executes all given statements and returns the value of the last statement. Do is commonly used with loop statements, but it can also be useful in other situations on its own such as doing inline calculations. (note) The do keyword is also used to define top level statement when do is used as a message name.

function-do.convo

```convo
> do
n = 0
while( lt( n 10 ) ) do (
    // increment by 1
    n = inc(n)
)

// 22
sumWithDo=add( 5 do(
    sum = mul(n 2)
    sum = sub( sum 3 )
))

> assistant
n = {{n}}
sumWithDo = {{sumWithDo}}

```

#### switch( value:any ...valueOrCase:any ), case( value:any ), test( condition:any ), default()

Switch can be used as either and switch statement or a ternary. When the switch function has exactly 3 arguments and non of the is a case or default statement then switch acts as a ternary.

function-switch.convo

```convo
> do
// can be 0 to 9
value = rand(9)

// can be 20 to 29
value2 = add(20 rand(9))

message=''


switch(

    // Sets the current match value of the switch. The match value of a switch statement can be
    // changed further down the switch
    value

    case(0) message = "Lowest"

    case(1) do(
        message = "Value is 1"
    )

    case(2) do(
        message = "Number two"
    )

    case(3) do(
        message = "Tree or three"
    )

    // change the value to a value in ary
    value2

    case(20) do(
        message = "2 zero"
    )

    test(lt(value2 28)) do(
        message = "less than 28"
    )

    default() message = "Fall back to default"

)

print(message)

> assistant
value = {{value}}
value2 = {{value2}}
message = {{message}}

> do
// values matched by switches are returned and the value can be assigned to a variable
str = "two"
value = switch(
    str

    case("one") 1
    case("two") 2
    case("three") 3
)

// 2
print(value)

> assistant
value from switch = {{value}}


// switches can also be used as a ternary
> assistant
switch(true "yes" "no") = {{switch(true "yes" "no")}}

switch(false "yes" "no") = {{switch(false "yes" "no")}}
```

#### return( value:any )

Returns a value from the current function

function-return.convo

```convo

> customMath(
    a: number
    b: number
) -> (
    return mul( add(a b) b )
)

> do

value = customMath(a:4 b:3)

// 21
print(value)

> assistant
Return value = {{value}}

```

## Library Functions

Convo-Lang defines a standard set of libraries for common coding needs.

### now()

Returns the current date time as a timestamp. now uses Date.now() to get the current timestamp.

### dateTime( format?:string date?:string|number|Date )

Returns the current or given date as a formatted string.

```convo
// define is a top level statement and is being used to define 
> define
agentName="Willy"
pizzaToppings=[]
pizzaSize=null

// The system message instructs the agent how to behave and informs the agent about the
// current state of the pizza being ordered.
@edge

Your name is {{agentName}} and you're helping a user order a pizza. The pizza can have at most 5
toppings

Pizza Size: {{or(pizzaSize "Not set")}}
Pizza Toppings:
{{pizzaToppings}}

    # sm = Small
    # md = Medium
    # lg = Large
    size:enum("sm" "md" "lg")
) -> (
    pizzaSize=size
