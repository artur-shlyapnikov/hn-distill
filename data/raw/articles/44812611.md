I **love** dotfiles.

“Dotfiles” is a term that refers to configuration files used to configure software and operating systems. They are called such because often these files start with a dot. You may have seen `.bashrc`, `.tmux.conf` or `.zshrc` in the wild.

Whenever a software doesn’t offer direct file-based configuration, I feel sad because it means I need to take extra steps to keep my configuration across different devices in sync or when setting up a new machine.

I **love** sharing.

I regularly publish ideas and experiences in [my blog](https://hamatti.org/blog), I share my notes in [my digital garden](https://notes.hamatti.org/) and I publish almost all the code I write (outside work) as open source [in GitHub](https://github.com/hamatti).

I **love** to read [other people’s dotfiles](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=repositories) and learn from them.

Yet, somehow I feel like sharing my own dotfiles to the world is beyond my comfort zone. I feel my customisations and aliases and other decisions are too intimate and personal to share.

I don’t quite know why though.

I have a really cool repository where I keep my dotfiles and there’s quite a lot there. There’s the usual suspects like my `zsh` config and aliases, my `tmux` configuration and my `neovim` and `vscode` stuff too. And my [Python startup script](https://hamatti.org/posts/bring-your-custom-toolkit-to-repl-sessions/).

I also keep my [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) core list there: that’s all the packages I want to always have at hand. Having them all in one place to be installed with a single command on a new computer is lovely.

I also keep my [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) CSS rules there so I can easily bring the experience I want on any browser I use.

I use [GNU Stow to manage most of these](https://notes.hamatti.org/technology/recipes/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow). For anything that’s directly applicable by copying the files into a given folder, I’ve set up the folder structure so that running `stow [folder]` will create symlinks to right places: any change made into the repository from any machine will apply to all machines. It’s so cool.

All in all, my dotfiles repository is home to 19 configuration files + everything my neovim installation has, plugins and all.

For now however, I _keep them secret, keep them safe_ until I feel better about sharing my dotfiles with the world.
