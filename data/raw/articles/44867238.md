### What is the issue?

The original model coudl run without problem, but the gguf model fail to run for below errors

May need an update of ggml dependencies like llama.cpp [ggml-org/llama.cpp#15091](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15091)

Note: Running gguf on llama.cpp without problem.
