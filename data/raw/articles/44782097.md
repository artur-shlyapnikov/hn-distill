Researcher spots Sleeping Lady with Black Vase by Robert Bereny being used as a prop in Hollywood children’s movie

A long-lost avant garde painting has returned to [Hungary](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary) after nine decades thanks to a sharp-eyed art historian, who spotted it being used as a prop in the Hollywood film Stuart Little.

Gergely Barki, 43, a researcher at Hungary’s national gallery in Budapest, noticed Sleeping Lady with Black Vase by Róbert Berény as he watched television with his daughter Lola in 2009.

“I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw Bereny’s long-lost masterpiece on the wall behind Hugh Laurie. I nearly dropped Lola from my lap,” said Barki. “A researcher can never take his eyes off the job, even when watching Christmas movies at home.”

The painting disappeared in the 1920s, but Barki recognised it immediately even though he had only seen a faded black-and-white photo from an exhibition in 1928.

He sent a flurry of emails to staff at the film’s makers, Sony Pictures and Columbia Pictures, and received a reply from a former set designer on the film – two years later.

“She said the picture had been hanging on her wall,” Barki said.

“She had snapped it up for next to nothing in an antiques shop in Pasadena, California, thinking its avant garde elegance was perfect for Stuart Little’s living room.”

After leaving Sony, she sold the painting to a private collector who has now brought the picture to Budapest for sale by auction.

Berény, the leader of a pre-first world war avant garde movement called the Group of Eights, fled to Berlin in 1920 after designing recruitment posters for Hungary’s short-lived communist revolution in 1919.

In the German capital, he had a romance with the actor Marlene Dietrich, and – according to Barki – is also rumoured to have had a fling with Anastasia, the mysterious daughter of Russia’s last tsar, Nicholas II.

Berény’s painting will be sold on 13 December, with a starting price of around €110,000 (£87,000), staff at the Virag Judit auction house said.

According to Barki, the buyer at the 1928 exhibition, who was possibly Jewish, is likely to have left Hungary before or during the second world war.

“After the wars, revolutions and tumult of the 20th century, many Hungarian masterpieces are lost, scattered around the world,” he said.

At this dangerous moment for dissent
------------------------------------

I hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, I wanted to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US.

When the military is deployed to quell overwhelmingly peaceful protest, when elected officials of the opposing party are arrested or handcuffed, when student activists are jailed and deported, and when a wide range of civic institutions – non-profits, law firms, universities, news outlets, the arts, the civil service, scientists – are targeted and penalized by the federal government, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that our core freedoms are disappearing before our eyes – and democracy itself is slipping away.

In any country on the cusp of authoritarianism, the role of the press as an engine of scrutiny, truth and accountability becomes increasingly critical. At the Guardian, we see it as our job not only to report on the suppression of dissenting voices, but to make sure those voices are heard.

Not every news organization sees its mission this way – indeed, some have been pressured by their corporate and billionaire owners to avoid antagonizing this government. I am thankful the Guardian is different.

Our only financial obligation is to fund independent journalism in perpetuity: we have no ultrarich owner, no shareholders, no corporate bosses with the power to overrule or influence our editorial decisions. Reader support is what guarantees our survival and safeguards our independence – and every cent we receive is reinvested in our work.

The Guardian’s global perspective helps contextualize and illuminate what we are experiencing in this country. That doesn’t mean we have a single viewpoint, but we do have a shared set of values. Humanity, curiosity and honesty guide us, and our work is rooted in solidarity with ordinary people and hope for our shared future.

**It has never been more urgent, or more perilous, to pursue reporting in the US that holds power to account and counters the spread of misinformation – and at the Guardian we make our journalism free and accessible to all. Can you spare just 37 seconds now to support our work and protect the free press?**

**We value whatever you can spare, but a recurring contribution makes the most impact, enabling greater investment in our most crucial, fearless journalism. As our thanks to you, we can offer you some great benefits – including seeing far fewer fundraising messages like this. We’ve made it very quick to set up, so we hope you’ll consider it. Thank you.**

Bill Owen - trademark turn-down wellies, woolly yarmulke, and appearing like some horrifying mutant fusion of pensioner scrotum and gurning sprout - had somehow, with Nora Batty and her unique embodiment of anti-acting, become caged in a supermarket-trolley, resulting in the pair of them plummeting down one of the steeper declivities of the Yorkshire moors before plunging, fully-clothed into a river at the bottom of the hill; all the above accompanied by the plaintive wheeze of a Hazlehurst composition and the astounded hoots and roars of a party of geriatrics on a day-trip from Batley.

Cut to Foggy's parlour:

Brian Wilde banging-on in military vernacular about some inane plan, while Sallis and Owen giggle and hiss at each other - and then I spotted it, about an inch or two to the left of Foggy Dewhurst’s right shoulder.

There was no mistaking those shades of mustard, khaki, broad bean green and Airfix yellow. I was positive that I was looking at Nash’s lost masterpiece Sunrise over Ypres – November 1917. I lifted myself off the settee and crawled to the 22 inch Hitachi in an effort to get a better butcher’s.

Imagine my disappointment, when on closer inspection of the telly, I discovered, that instead of looking at a lost Nash masterwork, it was a screen smear of piccalilli, left over as the shaming evidence from a debauched night-in of some 3 months prior - the outcome of 12 too many Hofmeister’s, a rug-corner trip, stagger, fall and sickening coccyx wallop, and resulting in the loss of a freshly prepared snack (that I was guardedly transporting back from the kitchen) of Carr’s Table Water Biscuit, taste-bud piercing mature cheddar, and piccalilli pokey enough to instantly induce a beaded forehead on initial ingestion.

After much intoxicated searching and with faint echoes of an Alan Bennett production, I found the cracker under the sideboard, but was at a loss to the eventual resting place of the pickle slathered cheddar. Clearly, for the past 12 weeks, it had making a slow descent down the front of the cathode ray tube like a moldering cheese snail leaving an acidulous yellow trail.

Of course, it now means, that whenever I come in contact with work by Mr. Nash, in one of our fine provincial galleries, I’m always struck by the sheer piccalilliness of his palette. Maybe there’s a PHD thesis on the influence of strong, mustardy pickles in the work of British War Artists?

And, just have a gander at some of that old ‘Churchill bater’ Graham Sutherland’s stuff. He was definitely a boy for the hot, yellow, vinegary stuff.

Of course, of course! :) We need a Mr Barki-like researcher though. Or would you be prepared to do the honours? (Thanks for this screamingly funny piece.)

Did I upset someone because I giggled at the re-inventing as 'masterpiece' of a pointless daub that had been duly dumped? (Bit illiberal this, from the Guardian, this flagship of liberalism.)
