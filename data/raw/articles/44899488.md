# Linux Address Space Isolation "ASI" Revived After Lowering 70% Performance Hit To 13%

Several years ago Google engineers began exploring address space isolation for the Linux kernel and ultimately proposing [Linux ASI for better dealing with CPU speculative execution attacks](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-LPC-ASI-2022). While the hope was it would better cope with the ever growing list of CPU speculative execution vulnerabilities, the effort was thwarted initially by [I/O throughput seeing a 70% performance hit](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-Linux-ASI-v2-RFC-Patches). That level of performance cost was unsustainable. But now that I/O overhead has been reduced to _just_ 13%.  
  
Google engineer Brendan Jackman is back to bringing up ASI to Linux kernel developers now that "_ASI is fast again...I've now prepared an up-to-date ASI branch that demonstrates a technique for solving the page cache performance devastation...The goal of this prototype is to increase confidence that ASI is viable as a broad solution for CPU vulnerabilities. (If the community still has to develop and maintain new mitigations for every individual vuln, because ASI only works for certain use-cases, then ASI isn't super attractive given its complexity burden). The biggest gap for establishing that confidence was that Google's deployment still only uses ASI for KVM workloads, not bare-metal processes. And indeed the page cache turned out to be a massive issue that Google just hasn't run up against yet internally._"

Random reads with FIO were still hit by a 13% regression but at least better than 70%. ASI in current form also increased Linux kernel compilation times by 6~7%. Jackman added:  

> "Despite my title these numbers are kinda disappointing to be honest, it's not where I wanted to be by now, but it's still an order-of-magnitude better than where we were for native FIO a few months ago. I believe almost all of this remaining slowdown is due to unnecessary ASI exits, the key areas being:  
>   
> \- On every context\_switch(). Google's internal implementation has fixed this (we only really need it when switching mms).  
>   
> \- Whenever zeroing sensitive pages from the allocator. This could potentially be solved with the ephmap but requires a bit of care to avoid opening CPU attack windows.  
>   
> \- In copy-on-write for user pages. The ephmap could also help here but the current implementation doesn't support it (it only allows one allocation at a time per context)."

  
With [this LKML thread](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250812173109.295750-1-jackmanb@google.com/T/#u) the hope now is to figure out if the state is improving good enough that the ASI work can move forward for potentially upstreaming into the Linux kernel.  

> "So, x86 folks: Does this feel like "line of sight" to you? If not, what would that look like, what experiments should I run?"

  
We'll see what happens of Linux ASI.
