#### Permissive license

These models are supported by the Apache 2.0 license. Build freely without worrying about copyleft restrictions or patent risk—whether you're experimenting, customizing, or deploying commercially.

#### Full chain-of-thought

Access the full chain-of-thought for easier debugging and higher trust in model outputs.

### Interactive demo

We built a simple playground where developers can try both models in the browser.

#### Safety is foundational to our open models

Each model has completed thorough safety training and evaluation to help developers keep users safe.

![Image 10: Icon representing scientific testing](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/1aA2FTnaCAcL47TDkJT4Zj/288035e728aa47ef16798794e30212e6/flask.svg?w=3840&q=90)

#### Comprehensive safety testing

We rigorously tested a maliciously fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-120b under our Preparedness Framework, and found that it doesn’t reach high capability levels. These training and testing methods were reviewed and informed by external safety experts, and mark a meaningful advancement in open model safety standards.
