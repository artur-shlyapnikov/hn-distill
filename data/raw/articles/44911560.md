### Uh oh!

There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

This is based on previous PR ([#2787](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/2787), [#2449](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/2449) and [#3154](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/3154)) with work done by [@pinpox](https://github.com/pinpox), [@m4w0lf](https://github.com/m4w0lf), [@Sheap](https://github.com/Sheap), [@bmunro-peralex](https://github.com/bmunro-peralex), [@tribut](https://github.com/tribut) and others I probably missed sorry.

This PR add support for OpenId Connect to handle authentication to an external SSO.  
This introduce another way to control who can use the vault without having to use invitation or an LDAP.

A master password is still required and not controlled by the SSO (depending on your point of view this might be a feature ;).

Bitwarden [key connector](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-key-connector) is not supported and due to the [license](https://github.com/bitwarden/key-connector/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) it's highly unlikely that it will ever be:

> 2.1 Commercial Module License. Subject to Your compliance with this Agreement, Bitwarden hereby grants to You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Commercial Modules for the sole purposes of internal development and internal testing, and only in a non-production environment.

## Usage

This should be agnostic to the SSO used as long as it supports client secret authentication and expose an OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint. (I'm testing it with Keycloak at the moment, a demo test stack is available [README.md](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/blob/sso-support/test/oidc/README.md))

Added some documentation at the root of the project [SSO.md](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/blob/sso-support/SSO.md) that could be later moved to the wiki.

I made some additional modification in my [main branch](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/blob/main/README.md) to allow for easier testing (modified Docker image to use prebuilt patched front-end).

On front-end modification, I made patched versions available at [Timshel/oidc\_web\_builds](https://github.com/Timshel/oidc_web_builds). Two versions are available :

*   One contains the change expected to be merged (named `button`); all change needs to be compatible with the non-sso version.
*   Second one set `#sso` as the default redirect url.

## Issues

As mentioned in the previous PR one of the main issue is the inability for the organization invitation to work with the SSO redirection. To fix it a [patch](https://github.com/Timshel/oidc_web_builds/blob/master/oidc_invite.patch) to the front-end is needed.

## **⚠️⚠️ ⚠️ If you have issues or need help testing the PR ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️**

Please open issues in [Timshel/vaultwarden](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/issues) in order to keep the discussion here focused on merging this work.  
Of course if you believe your issue is important mention this PR so a reference will be visible.

But please try to keep commenting in this PR to a minimum to keep it legible, the previous one has over 200 comments ...

Sorry, something went wrong.

Just added a configuration example for [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) which might be one of easiest way to test this PR :).

Hi [@Timshel](https://github.com/Timshel), thanks for your amazing and prolonged work on this feature, is this PR close to be in a ready merge-able state or is there a lot of work left?  
I see the latest commit is about documentation, so, all issues mentioned at the beginning were fixed in some way or another ? Or there are still issue to fix ?

I do not have much time actually.

Also, I'm a bit puzzled with all the different SSO PR's.  
And I am a bit hesitant to merge one if that for some reason could break the other or has a totally different way of working.  
I'm not sure what to do here because i see people want something like this, but there are multiple ways of getting this working it looks like.

One way would be to create a semi-supported release branch which contains SSO support, but that could get messy keeping it up-to-date. What do you think [@dani-garcia](https://github.com/dani-garcia) ?

? As mentioned this is the continuation of the previous PRs, it all rely on [openidconnect](https://docs.rs/openidconnect/latest/openidconnect/). All of those PR are based on the previous ones when the previous PR owner stopped maintaining it.

I can´t speak for the owner of previous PRs but I believe this make all the others redundant. You could probably close the previous one referencing this one and encourage their owner to reopen if something is missing.

Thanks [@bmunro-peralex](https://github.com/bmunro-peralex) for closing his PR to make things more legible and of course for his work which is present in this PR :).

Why not finally add at least one way to support OIDC? You can also flag it as preview feature or something like this to get feedback from the community, but not getting this feature into Vaultwarden after multiple PRs were provided by the community without a review or without getting merged for months until the authors then gave up feels wrong to me for an open source project.

Well, because One way could be a different way then the others, or could cause a lot of other changes needed to be done if they do not match, or maybe even could overlap and do something totally different. 49 FIles are changed, so I'm not going to be happy if there needs to be major rework done because of adding this feature which is not fully working/supported.

You have to keep in mind that this could break other code in some way. But as said before, i do not have much time to check and validate this. And this is a huge PR and a lot of testing needs to be done, and i this is not specifically on my prio list for now actually. That is why i mentioned a special branch, which builds this version with a different tag and not fully supported in terms of issues with the login from my side.

[@BlackDex](https://github.com/BlackDex) I'll insist but there is no other way (At least not in the currently opened PRs). All those PR are based on the previous ones. They got more refined each time as someone picked-it up.

[@BlackDex](https://github.com/BlackDex) thinking on it I don´t think the semi-supported branch is a good idea.

Main issue for people running this branch is that there might be some change in the migrations that might force to correct DB state manually. Even if it's not difficult (cf [Timshel/vaultwarden#db-migration](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/tree/main#db-migration)), integrating in a separate branch would not help with this.

Additionally unless you grant me commit rights it means that this would make it more complicated for me to support it and if you have no time for review I can't see how you would semi-support it.

It's important to note that the `SSO_ENABLED` config act as feature flag, the impact on the non sso version is quite low so merging this should have a low risk for the non sso users.

In the end if people are not running it at the moment it might be because they are waiting for an easier way to run this (but I made updates on [main@Timshel/vaultwarden](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/tree/main) to make it easier) but I would expect it's mainly because they are waiting for it to be reviewed, a solution without any review would not be worth much ...

Since I'm running this myself I will maintain this branch/PR, and will continue to update [main@Timshel/vaultwarden](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/tree/main) with anything I can think of to help people running it. As mentioned before if you have any question don't hesitate but please open it on [Timshel/vaultwarden](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/issues) to prevent spamming here (of course mention this PR if you think your issue is important).

In my opinion the next step is for it to be reviewed and then integrated (maybe without being promoted at first).

It seems that there is a lot of hesitation on investing time into reviewing this and i can understand this. However - the longer the delay the bigger the diff guys. The branch clearly works and simply needs a bit more love. Besides it already looks like a lot of work went into this and the older preceding branches. Why not make it a beta build? Even 2.0.0-beta? The closer it is to the main stream, the quicker will be the feedback and the improvement. Let's not forget this is open source, where ideas thrive and not corporate where ideas die ;)

Okay I've done a bit more testing and this is ready for merge. Big thanks to [@Timshel](https://github.com/Timshel) and all the contributors that helped to get this finished!

I've copied the SSO docs to the wiki, and they can be viewed here, I'll open a follow up PR deleting the file from the repo later:  
[https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-SSO-support-using-OpenId-Connect](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-SSO-support-using-OpenId-Connect)

For everyone excited to try this, the changes will be part of the `vaultwarden/server:testing` image when the builds are done in half an hour or so. There is no set schedule for a stable release yet, but I can imagine it'll probably happen in 2-4 weeks assuming we don't find any critical bugs.

I just want to shout out how much I appreciate the team behind this PR. I can see how much effort and care was put into this feature, and I'm looking forward to pulling the latest version of the official vaultwarden image with this new OIDC feature.

Great job, and thanks again for your hard work.

[@Timshel](https://github.com/Timshel) what about some features that we discussed back in the days, that will not be part of this PR, like [https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden#role-mapping](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden#role-mapping)? From now on, we should stick and open issue/pr/fr about sso in forks or rejoin also that part here?

Just a quick note: SSO feature wasn't working in the Bitwarden desktop app. I tried it about two weeks ago, and it's working there now, too.

[@rizlas](https://github.com/rizlas)

SSO in the Desktop app is Not working when using chrome. I dont know whether this is a general Bitwarden issue or linked to specific issue with this work.  
However when we use Firefox it's working fine and there is an issue opened in the original Bitwarden project but does not seem that there is some progress. It would be very nice to get sso working in the desktop app when using chrome.

Probably not something this project can fix.

[@BlackDex](https://github.com/BlackDex)  
Yes but until today I dont know what the issue is and the case opened in the original project is not researched too.  
I can't imagine that people using the original project having this issue as well. For enterprise users sso in the desktop app is mandatory I guess.

No I mean I dont know if this issue also exists when using Bitwarden officially with enterprise functions included.

I cannot test this because I don't have a Bitwarden subscription.

Is it possible to have a nested structure for roles?

Comparing this to Open WebUI:

`OAUTH_ROLES_CLAIM` - The claim that contains the roles. Defaults to roles. Can also be nested, for example user.roles.

> e excited to try this, the changes will be part of the `vaultwarden/server:testing` image when the builds are done in half an hour or so. There is no set schedule for a stable release yet, but I can imagine it'll probably happen in 2-4 weeks assuming we don't find any critical bugs.

[@Timshel](https://github.com/Timshel) [@BlackDex](https://github.com/BlackDex)  
just tried to switch to the testing build but i noticed that the SSO\_FRONTEND='override' is not woring so you wont be redirected to the sso page.  
Can you confirm this ?

Features mentioned [here](https://github.com/Timshel/vaultwarden/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#additionnal-features) were not part of this PR, and the equivalent of the `override` client is not expected to be distributed by the `Vaultwarden` team.

[@Timshel](https://github.com/Timshel)  
thanks for this explaination.

[@BlackDex](https://github.com/BlackDex)  
is there a possibility to get this implemented ? It would be difficult to explain all people to first complete sso before they can enter their vaultwarden credentials.  
It would be very helpful to redirect the login page to sso only.

Will there be something like `SSO_ADMIN_CLAIM`/`SSO_USER_CLAIM` for specifying roles?

[@TheDarkula](https://github.com/TheDarkula) not sure what the env variable are supposed to do, but if you want role mapping I already opened [#6158](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/6158) to add access to the admin console depending on role and will open one for Organization and groups sync later on.

found something related to the sso issue:

It seems like this has something to do with the url length of the sso callback. Its opening the bitwarden app if i cut the link down to 2046 limit.

there is also a chromium issue opened about this:

[@gjuuz](https://github.com/gjuuz) this would explain things since I wrap the `code` in a JWT token to be able to pass more information.  
I'll check if I can't do things differently with latest client version, thx.
