# Pebble Time 2\* Design Reveal

\[2025-08-13\]

**TL;DR**

*   Pebble Time 2 Design reveal
*   Available in 4 colourways
*   Final specifications
*   How to change your pre-order from P2D to PT2‚Ä¶

Like what you see? You can still [pre-order Pebble Time 2](https://store.repebble.com/) for $225!

First off, for those who didn‚Äôt catch the [news from a few weeks ago](https://ericmigi.com/blog/july-pebble-update) - we‚Äôve been able to recover the Pebble trademark! Our new watches will change from being called Core 2 Duo ‚Üí Pebble 2 Duo, and Core Time 2 ‚Üí Pebble Time 2.

The big news today is that we‚Äôre revealing the final design for Pebble Time 2. The design that we showed off back in March were preliminary designs. We've been able to tweak and improve the industrial design quite a bit since then. I think it‚Äôs turned out fantastically well! I even have a working albeit early engineering sample on my wrist.

### Colourways

We‚Äôre planning to release 4 different Pebble Time 2 colourways. These haven‚Äôt been finalized yet. No names yet, we still need to pick them!

After the colourways are locked down, we‚Äôll email everyone who placed a pre-order for Pebble Time 2 and ask them to pick a colour. No need to email us now about it üòâ
