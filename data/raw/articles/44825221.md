How does container monitoring work?
-----------------------------------

The [TrayceAgent](https://github.com/evanrolfe/trayce_agent/) container runs along side your existing containers. The agent uses eBPF probes to intercept network requests and send them back to the GUI to be displayed.

Protocols Supported:

*   HTTP
*   HTTPS (for Go and OpenSSL-based languages like Python, Ruby etc.) 
*   GRPC
*   MySQL
*   Postgres

Who is it for?
--------------

Trayce container monitoring is intended for anyone wanting to see whats going on inside their **local** Docker containers: backend developers, QA engineers, testers etc. It is not intended for production monitoring.
