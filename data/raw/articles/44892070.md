Perhaps one of the greatest strategy games of the 16-bit era, _The Settlers_, did not get a sequel on Amiga. So, when _The Settlers II_ came out in 1996, only MS-DOS and Mac OS enjoyed it. Aside from a release for Nintendo Wii in 2007, it didn’t land on any other platforms.

So, what about the Amiga? Well, amazing news has just dropped: _The Settlers II Gold Edition_ (the 1997 edition) is coming to the Amiga in October 2025.

> **The legendary construction strategy classic finally comes to the Amiga!**
> 
> In 1993_, The Settlers_ revolutionized gaming on the Amiga and invented a completely new genre: the strategy game. When in 1996 the even more ambitious and still beloved successor _The Settlers II_ appeared, the king of the home computer did not get it. Almost 30 years later, this gaming story is finally corrected!
> 
> With official license from Ubisoft Entertainment is _The Settlers II Gold Edition_ from 18. October 2025 natively available for the Amiga. Not as a fast port, but as a lovingly optimized version that shows what the Amiga really has on it.

## The Settlers II: This is not a port

As stated, this isn’t a port, but an optimized version that is designed to run on the Amiga. Published by Look Behind You, _The Settlers II Gold Edition_ is licensed by Ubisoft, which many of us will find absolutely astonishing. However, be aware that it is only intended for AGA or PowerPC Amigas.

![](https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png.webp)

_The Settlers II Gold Edition_ for Amiga features:

> *   Thousands of lovingly animated subjects
> *   more than 30 different professional groups, including 6 soldier types
> *   4 different peoples with different character types: Romans, Asians, Nubians and Vikings
> *   various landscape elements such as lava, ice areas, marshes, forests and much more, including the cool winter landscape from The Settlers II Mission Disk
> *   10 Roman campaigns and 9 world campaigns
> *   130 free bonus cards
> *   integrated in-game help and optimized playing interface
> *   4 languages: complete in German and English, in-game also in French and Polish

Minimum system requirements for AGA systems requires more than a basic system, however.

> *   Amiga with AGA chipset
> *   68040 with 40 MHz
> *   32 MB Fast RAM
> *   AmigaOS 3.1
> *   AHI 4.18
> *   600 MB free hard disk space

Hi-res graphics are available with this, but you’ll need an accelerator card, or PiStorm.

If you’re using original hardware, you’ll need to have upgraded the RAM, added a hard disk, and upgraded to AmigaOS 3.1. Further system requirements for AGA and PowerPC can be found on the [Look Behind You website](https://lookbehindyou.de/produkt/diesiedler2amiga/) (be sure to click the English language version on the home page if you’re not a German speaker!) It should also run on emulators and [The A500 Mini](https://gamingretro.co.uk/the-a500-mini-explained-in-just-2-minutes/ "The A500 Mini Explained in Just 2 Minutes").

Three editions of _The Settlers II Gold Edition_ are available for Amiga:

> *   **Box Edition (available from October 18, 2025):** This physical edition will feature a classic box format with a slip lid for € 49.90 and will include a DVD plus download option, the colored world atlas, manuals in German and English, as well as four exclusive and collectible retro-design postcards.
> *   **Collector’s Edition (available from December 1, 2025):** The game’s deluxe version will be available for € 99.90 as a wooden box in the original Settlers II design; it will be limited to 100 copies and will also include an exclusive metal magnet (8×5 cm) with the iconic castle motif from the first Settlers game—a real gem for every Amiga enthusiast and box collector.
> *   **Digital Edition (available from October 18, 2025):** For immediate gaming fun, a download-only version will also be available for € 29.90.

The official launch is at Amiga40 on the 18th October 25 in Mönchengladbach. Hit that link to pre-order now and get a high-quality art print alongside exclusive maps.
