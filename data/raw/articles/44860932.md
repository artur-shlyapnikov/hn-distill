# Basic Guide

The basic guide covers the core concepts of social interaction. It contains three sections made up of seventeen in-depth lessons, and it's 100% free.

If you find the basic guide helpful, please share it with your friends or your favorite social skills forum. Also, don't forget to check out the [member's guide](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/advanced-social-skills-guide "Advanced Guide") once you finish reading the basic guide. Good luck, and enjoy improving your social skills!

*   **[Foundations](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/foundations "Foundations")**

Think of _Foundations_ as the introduction to the guide. It explains how to get the most out of the guide and gives advice about achieving your social goals.  I wrote _Foundations_ to help you think through your goals and motivations, and I include guidance for overcoming fear and the temptation of manipulation.

*   **[Body Language](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/body-language "Body Language")**

In _Body Language_, I teach how to decipher the two key body language signals : "Comfort" and "Discomfort." I explain how to respond when someone is comfortable or uncomfortable, and also show you how to use your own body language to send positive messages.

*   **[Conversation](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/conversation "Conversation")**

_Conversation_ is your guide to smooth, comfortable conversation. I explain how the principle of "Inspiration and Invitation" enables you to have smooth, enjoyable conversation with anyone, on any topic.

*   **[Support Your Friends](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/how-to-support-friends "How To Support Your Friends")**

It's important to be there for your friends when they are struggling. In _Support Your Friends_, I share helpful tips that will prepare you to support others.

*   **[Quick How-To Guides](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/social-skills-how-to-guides "Quick How-To Guides")**

Sometimes you just want some quick tips that will improve your social skills fast. That's what my _Quick How-To Guides_ are about. They only take a few minutes to learn and apply, and the benefits are immediate.
