Email threads have got to be one of the worst possible forms of communication. You've been here before. A perfectly respectable morning is passing by. You're working through your items at a chipper pace maybe humming a song you heard on Spotify that morning. Then, the dreaded email thread comes through.

Innocently, you click into the top email. The only text is "[Your Name] see below."

I hate this and I bet you do too.

Suddenly, you're transported into absolute chaos.

You're now a corporate archeologist and firefighter all in one. Forced to decode the two week long thread of baloney while being asked to complete some ambiguous task.

Well, guess what? I don't read them, not anymore.

If an email thread comes in that's longer than a few paragraphs, you're going straight to Copilot. It gets to decipher the weeks long back and forth bickering to get to what I need to know.

Please, please - stop email threads.

Emails: Written communication that needs to be documentable or a complex task

Documentation (Confluence, Word, etc.): Repeatable process and procedures or recordings of key decisions

IM (Teams, Slack, etc.): Actual communication

Meetings: In the best possible way, arguing. If we meet and cannot possibly disagree, then it should have been an email.

Save a vibe today and send an IM instead of an email thread.
