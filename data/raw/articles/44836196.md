MXroute (@MXroute): "Congrats to @Fastmail, the only provider @Apple allows to send push notifications to the iOS Mail app. No announcement. No documentation. No access for anyone else. Just quiet favoritism. We genuinely like @Fastmail. We’re happy for them. But @Apple has chosen a winner in private, giving one provider a major advantage and refusing the same to everyone else. We’ve tried to talk. @Apple just stops responding once they realize what we’re asking. Our customers want answers, and unlike Apple, we don’t ignore them. We’re not going to be quiet. We’re just getting started." | XCancel

Congrats to [@Fastmail](https://xcancel.com/Fastmail "Fastmail"), the only provider [@Apple](https://xcancel.com/Apple "Apple") allows to send push notifications to the iOS Mail app. No announcement. No documentation. No access for anyone else. Just quiet favoritism. We genuinely like [@Fastmail](https://xcancel.com/Fastmail "Fastmail"). We’re happy for them. But [@Apple](https://xcancel.com/Apple "Apple") has chosen a winner in private, giving one provider a major advantage and refusing the same to everyone else. We’ve tried to talk. [@Apple](https://xcancel.com/Apple "Apple") just stops responding once they realize what we’re asking. Our customers want answers, and unlike Apple, we don’t ignore them. We’re not going to be quiet. We’re just getting started.
