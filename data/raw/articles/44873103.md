# A Vulkan on Metal Mesa 3D Graphics Driver

At LunarG, our mission is to empower developers with robust, high-performance graphics solutions. We’re thrilled to announce KosmicKrisp, LunarG’s new Vulkan driver for Apple hardware, built within the Mesa 3D graphics framework.

By focusing on Apple Silicon and leveraging Mesa’s Vulkan driver framework and robust tools, KosmicKrisp simplifies development and sets the stage for full Vulkan conformance at a pace that can keep up with the Vulkan API as it evolves. It is already close to Vulkan 1.3 conformance and is powering demos and workloads, including the Android Emulator, with promising early performance.

“Google is committed to providing Android developers with exceptional tools across all platforms, including strong support for Vulkan. We’re excited about how KosmicKrisp will enhance the Vulkan developer experience and make the Android Emulator even more powerful.”

_Serdar Kocdemir_  
_Senior Software Engineer at Google_  
_Tech Lead for Graphics on the Android Emulator_

## What’s Next?

In the coming months, we’ll:

*   Achieve Vulkan 1.3 conformance.
*   Submit a public merge request to Mesa.
*   Release an updated macOS SDK including both KosmicKrisp and MoltenVK for legacy support.

Learn about KosmicKrisp at Karen Ghavam’s Vulkan SDK update during the Khronos Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF), “Forging Forward with Vulkan,” on Wednesday, August 13, 4:30–6:00 PM PDT, at the Fairmont Waterfront Hotel, Waterfront Ballroom (lobby level), Vancouver, B.C. No SIGGRAPH registration is required, but register for the BOF here: [Khronos @ SIGGRAPH 2025](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/khronos-at-siggraph-2025-tickets-1420839080939?aff=oddtdtcreator). Then visit the LunarG table at the Khronos Networking Reception to see KosmicKrisp in action! Stay tuned for more details on this exciting step forward for the Vulkan development ecosystem.
