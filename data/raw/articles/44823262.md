🛡️ Stasher CLI
===============

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#%EF%B8%8F-stasher-cli)

Share secrets from your terminal. One-time only. No accounts. No backend. No BS.

🤔 Why?
-------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-why)

I just wanted to share a password.

 Not spin up a server. Not sign up for a "secure" web app.

 Not trust a Slack thread. Just. Send. A. Secret.

So I built Stasher — a burn-after-read, command-line tool for secure, ephemeral secret sharing.

 Built for people who are busy, paranoid, or both.

🔍 "How Can I Trust You?"
-------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-how-can-i-trust-you)

That's what someone asked me — and they were right to.

Even if I say:

_"It's encrypted"_

_"The key never touches the server"_

_"No logs, no tracking, no metadata"..._

How do you know I'm not lying?

🧠 I realized: the more secrecy your secrets require, the more transparency my system must offer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-i-realized-the-more-secrecy-your-secrets-require-the-more-transparency-my-system-must-offer)

So I built Stasher to prove itself.

🔐 Everything Is Verifiable
---------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-everything-is-verifiable)

Every Stasher release:

✅ Is cryptographically signed with Cosign

✅ Includes a SLSA v1 provenance attestation

✅ Publishes a signed SBOM with all dependencies + licenses

✅ Is logged in the Rekor transparency log

✅ Comes with full verification instructions

📖 Every Line of Code Is Public
-------------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-every-line-of-code-is-public)

Everything that runs Stasher is open and verifiable:

🔧 [CLI](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli)

🛰️ [API](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-api)

🖥️ [App](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-app)

⚙️ [CI/CD](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-ci)

🌐 [Website](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-website)

**🛡️ The only thing we don't expose? Your secret. Everything else is yours to inspect.**

💡 Why You Might Actually Care
------------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-why-you-might-actually-care)

🔐 **Zero-knowledge encryption** – AES-256-GCM, done locally

💣 **Burn-after-read** – one use, then it's gone forever

🧰 **CLI-first** – pipe it, script it, automate it

⚡ **No setup** – just run it with `npx`

⌛ **10-minute expiry** – with proactive + reactive cleanup

📜 **Full supply chain transparency** – signed, attested, and public

🚀 Try It Now
-------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-try-it-now)

undefinedshell
npx enstash "the launch code is 🍌-42"
# → Outputs: uuid:key

npx destash "uuid:key"
# → Reveals the secret and deletes it forever
undefined

🔐 Trust, But Actually Verify
-----------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-trust-but-actually-verify)

undefinedshell
# Verify latest release
VERSION=$(npm view stasher-cli version)
npm pack stasher-cli@$VERSION

cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli/.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --signature="stasher-cli-$VERSION.tgz.sig" \

🛠 Usage
--------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-usage)

### Enstash (Create a Secret)

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#enstash-create-a-secret)

undefinedshell
# From a string
enstash "don't forget to feed the AI"

# From a file
cat .env | enstash

# From stdin with npx
echo "my passphrase is secret123" | npx enstash
undefined

### Destash (Read + Burn)

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#destash-read--burn)

undefinedshell
destash "uuid:base64key"
npx destash "uuid:base64key"
undefined

### Unstash (Manual Delete)

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#unstash-manual-delete)

undefinedshell
unstash "uuid"
unstash "uuid:base64key"
undefined

🧪 Examples
-----------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-examples)

undefinedshell
# Share Wi-Fi password with a guest
npx enstash "yesits1234dontjudge"

# Send a one-time OTP via Slack
npx enstash "OTP: 842991"

# Share a deployment key, then delete it
echo "DEPLOY_KEY=super-secret" | npx enstash
npx unstash "uuid"

# Send a secret via pigeon 🐦
npx enstash "vault code: 1234#"
# (Remind them: 10-minute expiry)
undefined

🔍 How It Works
---------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-how-it-works)

### 🔐 **Client-Side Encryption**

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-client-side-encryption)

Stasher encrypts with **AES-256-GCM** before sending anything

It uploads: ciphertext, IV, and tag — **never the key**

You get a `uuid:base64key` token to share

### ⏱ **Hybrid Expiry System**

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-hybrid-expiry-system)

**Reactive expiry**: validated on every access

**Proactive cleanup**: background Durable Object alarms

**Atomic**: each stash is guarded by its own isolated gatekeeper (one DO per UUID)

### 💥 **Burn-After-Read**

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-burn-after-read)

Once `destash` is called, the secret is revealed and the stash is burned

No replays, no race conditions — **guaranteed**

🚫 Limits
---------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-limits)

| Feature | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Max size | 4 KB |
| Time to live | 10 minutes |
| Access | One-time |

📦 Install (Optional)
---------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-install-optional)

undefinedshell
npm install -g stasher-cli
undefined

…but honestly? `npx` is faster and cleaner.

🧪 Roadmap
----------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-roadmap)

🔄 Add `--json` output format for programmatic use

 ⏰ Support custom TTL (time-to-live) settings

 🔊 Add `--verbose` flag for debugging

 🌐 Web interface integration

 📁 Binary file support with base64 encoding

🌐 Architecture
---------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-architecture)

Powered by **Cloudflare Edge**, built for security:

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Atomic logic | Durable Objects |
| Storage | KV (encrypted only) |
| Expiry logic | Reactive validation + alarms |
| Race protection | Per-secret DO isolation |

🧠 Built for Me. Maybe for You Too.
-----------------------------------

[](https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli#-built-for-me-maybe-for-you-too)

This started as a scratch-my-own-itch project.

 Now it's a zero-trust, burn-after-read tool with full cryptographic supply chain verification.

If that sounds like overkill — good. That's kind of the point.
