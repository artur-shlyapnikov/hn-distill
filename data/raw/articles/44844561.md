Tribblix is an open source operating system created by Peter Tribble. Based on [illumos](https://www.illumos.org/), it blends a retro style with modern components.

**NEWS:** July 13th 2025: Milestone 37 available. ([updates](http://www.tribblix.org/Changes/changes-in-0m37.html)). Vanilla Tribblix and LX (aka "omnitribblix") variants for x86 are now available. ([download](http://www.tribblix.org/download.html) - [X86 Release Notes](http://www.tribblix.org/relnotes.html#m37-x86).)

**NEWS:** July 29th 2025. SPARC upgrades from m32 to m33 now available, for now fresh installs should use the m32 ISO and run an upgrade. ([SPARC Release Notes](http://www.tribblix.org/relnotes.html#m33-sparc).)

**NEWS:** May 15th 2025. CDROM sized ISO for m32 SPARC now available. ([download](http://www.tribblix.org/download.html#sparc) - [SPARC Release Notes](http://www.tribblix.org/relnotes.html#m32-sparc).)

**Important:**[32-bit hardware support now completely removed](http://www.tribblix.org/32bit.html).

While the SPARC version still suffers from lack of testing and has spotty hardware support, the x86 version is pretty solid. You can [download](http://www.tribblix.org/download.html) the image, [install](http://www.tribblix.org/install.html) to a hard drive, and [use it](http://www.tribblix.org/use.html).
