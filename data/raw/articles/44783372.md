Abstract
--------

We present Splatshop, a highly optimized toolbox for interactive editing (selection, deletion, painting, transformation, ...) of 3D Gaussian Splatting models. Utilizing a comprehensive collection of heuristic approaches, we carefully balance between exact and fast rendering to enable precise editing without sacrificing real-time performance. Our experiments confirm that Splatshop achieves these goals for scenes with up to 100 million primitives. We also show how our proposed pipeline can be extended for use with head-mounted displays. As such, Splatshop is the first VR-capable editor for large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting models and a step towards a “Photoshop for Gaussian Splatting.”
