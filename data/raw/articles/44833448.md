# DF Direct Special: Digital Foundry Leaves IGN, Now Fully Independent - So What Happens Next?

Published on Aug. 7, 2025

Amazing news! Digital Foundry has parted ways with IGN and we've bought their shareholding in the business. What this means is that from now on, all aspects of DF are decided upon by DF. We answer to nobody but you, the audience. We are fully independent, we’re proud of that, we think it’s the future of games media - but how far we push, how ambitious we want to be... well, that's where YOU come in. Rich, John and Alex discuss the news in this brand new episode of DF Direct.
