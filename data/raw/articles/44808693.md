### Some thoughts on journals, refereeing, and the P vs NP problem

_A guest post by Eric Allender prompted by an_ _(incorrect)P≠ NP proof_ _[recently published](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11704-025-50231-4)in Springer Nature's Frontiers of Computer Science._

For a time, I served as Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Computation Theory, and in this role I had to deal regularly with submissions that claimed to resolve the P vs NP problem.Finding referees for these papers was sometimes challenging, so I frequently ended up reviewing them myself. Dealing with such submissions involves enough overhead that ToCT, J.ACM and ACM Transactions on Algorithms limit the frequency with which authors can submit work of this sort. But for every submission, on any topic, the overall process was the same: Find someone on the Editorial Board who has sufficient expertise to find referees and make knowledgeable use of their recommendations. If there was no such person on the Editorial Board, then it was always the case that the submission was out of scope for the journal.

These thoughts are brought to mind by a recent case, where it seems to me that the editorial process broke down.

Springer publishes several high-quality academic journals that deal with Theoretical Computer Science. One Springer journal, Frontiers of Computer Science, recently published an article entitled [SAT Requires Exhaustive Search](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11704-025-50231-4), where one of the authors is a Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the journal. The abstract of the article states that it proves a result that is stronger than P not equal to NP. The Editorial Board of the journal has some members who are expert in computational complexity theory. However, all the ones whom I know personally have asserted that they had no knowledge of this paper, and that they were not involved at all in handling the paper.

When Ryan Williams and I learned about the publication of this article, we drafted a [comment](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/papers/allender.williams.pdf), which we sent to the Editor-in-Chief. We recommended that the paper be retracted, in which case there would be no need to publish our comment. However, the Editor-in-Chief declined to retract the article, saying that he could find no evidence of misconduct, and thus we have been assured that an edited version of our comment will appear in the journal.

Our comment calls attention to some shortcomings in the proof of the main theorem (similar to shortcomings in several other failed attempts to separate P from NP). But we were able to say more. Often, when one is looking for bugs in a purported proof, one has to deal with the situation where the claimed theorem is probably true, and the only problem is that the proof is not convincing. However, the main theorem in their paper (Theorem 3.2) states that a particular constraint satisfaction problem requires time more than d c n for any constant c<1 (where d is the domain size, and n is the number of variables). In particular, their purported proof claims that this holds even when k=2 (meaning that each constraint has at most 2 variables). However, Ryan Williams [presented an algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2005.09.023) more than two decades ago that runs in time O(d(0.8)n) in this special case, contradicting the lower bound claimed in the article.

The article contains an appendix, with glowing testimonies from various researchers; the lead-in to the appendix also contains enthusiastic comments from Gregory Chaitin. I contacted Gregory Chaitin, and he asserts that he did not read the paper, and that he was quoted out of context.

The edited version of the [comment](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/papers/allender.williams.pdf)that Ryan Williams and I wrote, which will supposedly appear in Frontiers of Computer Science soon, differs from the version linked here (our original submission) primarily in one respect: Our closing paragraph was removed. Here is that paragraph:

> Finally, it is our opinion that the publication of this article is a complete embarrassment to this journal and its publisher. We believe that, at the very least, the paper should be withdrawn, and Springer should conduct an investigation to understand how such a paper could have made it through the peer review process.

**Update (Lance, 8/5/25):**The authors of the paper in question have asked me to link to [their reply to the Allender-Williams comment](https://github.com/kexu999/RBGame/blob/master/Reply_to_the_Comment.pdf). I do so with no endorsement.

Eric Allender asked me to note that their claim about Ryan’s algorithm requiring exponential space is misleading; the amount of space is not more than the runtime of the algorithm, which is less than the lower bound that they claim. (Their theorem does not state that d c n time is required under the additional assumption that the algorithm use only n O(1) space.)

This seems to be a popular topic. https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/445 but of course they don't perform peer review - it's just a preprint server.

With so many attempts, something will slip thru the cracks. Good job pointing this out!

If a paper does not brag that it solved P NE NP and that result appears in the middle of the paper, YES I can imagine that slipping through. but when the claim that P NE NP is in the abstract, this is not a `just slipped thru' scenario.

"Work of this sort" is referring to "submissions that claimed to resolve the P vs NP problem" from earlier in the paragraph.

This was a reference to the P/NP policy of these journals, which is described at length here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/toct/pnp-policy 

To save you from having to follow the link, here is what it says: "No author may submit more than one paper to J. ACM, ACM Trans. on Algorithms, or ACM Trans. on Computation Theory in any 24-month period, purporting to resolve the P versus NP question or related long-standing questions in complexity theory, except by invitation of the Editor-in-Chief. This applies to resubmissions of previously rejected manuscripts."

I am sorry that you found my language to be obnoxious.

Another thing: an editor in chief of the journal should be aware of how such a journal made it into its journal. This journal is not as wide ranging as TCS … also likely is that the co-author who is an editor made things happen where other papers would have gotten stuck

When I hear stuff like “ lGregory Chaitin. I contacted Gregory Chaitin, and he asserts that he did not read the paper, and that he was quoted out of context.” i cringe… what does this even mean? Did he say it or not? 

Is Greg still active in research or not? If not, I can understand. If you don’t read a paper, how do you have an opinion about it? How can you say something favorable other than … nice format and nice typeface! So something feels eerie here.

The paper says 'As of March 2025,more than 30 experts have provided highly positive feedback, including remarks like “truly revolutionary” from Prof. Gregory Chaitin'. I can believe Chaitin said something like "This result would be truly revolutionary if it's correct, so check the proof extremely carefully" and they quote-mined him.

Technically, you did not point out the error, but merely that Ryan's result and the paper are inconsistent and therefore at least one of them is wrong. :)

No, our full comment points to a serious (and obvious) mistake in the proof of the main result. The authors flatly assume that any algorithm for SAT must proceed by reducing an instance of size n to instances of size n-1 in a particular way. 

The fact that the statement of the main result was also directly refuted 20 years ago just makes the whole thing extra silly.

We should open a journal on proofs of P=NP and P\neq NP and any publications go in there. Problem solved?

World Scientific in 2016 even published a whole book implying P=NP, via a purported polynomial-size LP for TSP (something that was already disproved in our STOC'12 paper).

To be more precise & avoid confusion: they gave a purported polynomial-size extended formulation for the TSP polytope (which would imply a polynomial-size LP)

I took a look at the book wondering if the P=NP claim was buried in the middle (so the editor may have missed it) or overt (so no excuse to miss it). The TITLE of the book is fine: Advances in Combinatorial Optimization: LP formulations of the TSP and other hard opt problems (SO I THOUGHT: They will either formulate approx versions, or sho whow SOME TSP problems can be formulated as an LP or stuff like that). 

Money quote from the abstract on the website: This work also represents a proof of the equality of the complexity class ''P'' (polynomial time) and "NP" (nondeterministic polynomial time), and makes a contribution to the theory and application of `extended formulatins' (EFs). 

Nothing subtle about that. I wonder (a) why this was not caughy early in the procss, and (b) why this book from April 2016 was not noticed earlier. 

Next step: Either this book or the recent paper try to claim the $1,000,000 prize.

Sadly no- the book is an actual book, not an april fools day joke. For one thing, if it was an April fools day joke it would be a lot funnier.

@gasarch, wait I am confused now. The authors of the paper I thought are not claiming that they’re resolved PvsNP but instead resolved a question they thought was more relevant. Hence my belief is they are not after the 1 m usd prize money. Correct me if i am wrong.

Eric or Ryan- I did a blog post a while back about how `proofs' of P=NPor P NE NP have never (literally never) had an interesting idea in them. So NO ``They don't prove P=NP but they have an idea for a better SAT Solver' or `Theydon't prove P NE NP but the ideas here could lead to SAT not in n^2''

SO- is there ANYTHING of interest in the current paper?

There are sections of the paper that discuss the probability with which a random instance of CSP (in their model) is satisfiable. I didn't go through this part of their paper carefully, but the reference that David Eppstein provided in an earlier comment (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02071) indicates that people have gone through that argument carefully and found no real problems there. This is conceivably of interest, but I don't think that it is very helpful for understanding why P is not equal to NP (assuming that this is the case). The paper also contains philosophical discussions (with mentions of Wittgenstein and others), which would have been more interesting if their argument had been correct.

The Moser-Tardos Algorithm does not appear to be based on divide and conquer. As such, Xu and Zhou's assertion in their article that 'As we know, at least until now, all exact algorithms for CSPs are based on divide and conquer style, such as backtracking method' is inaccurate.

First of all thanks to Eric and Ryan for pointing this out. 

As a Ph.D. student in a peripherally related field who happen to see a post about this on X and came here, I am surprised that Eric/Ryan even bothered to draft this much of a comment in response to this paper in the first place. This paper seems to come out of a Chinese university that writes papers for the sake of publication alone, without any regards for quality. This reminds me of a similar instance a few years ago where one of the professors had purported to have discovered sequences that both converge and diverge (or something of this ridiculous sort), with the exception that this time the paper was even accepted to publication!

Alas, it is highly possible that there are many such instances (e.g., at ICML/NeurIPS) whose errors are undetected...

At reply from authors of paper. What do people think about it? It's hard to understand what is being conveyed partially because of language barrier and partially because the way it has been put down on paper. Good thing. The authors are real people. they do exist, they have a voice, and they have responded the comment.

They have voiced that they have been misunderstood. (ok fine this is not relevant)

They have addressed the point that Williams and Allender raised -- "we do not claim that such an algorithm is likely to suceed anyhow ..." so back to Wiliams and Allender:

So if you two claims that there might be other ways, but are somewhat confident that they might not work anyhow ... i am left in a bubble about what to think. You guys don't point out anything concrete but are on equal footing with the authors of the paper.

What they did not do ... they did or did not address the concrete example by Williams?

Can someone point out if they addressed this point?

 "(and obvious) mistake in the proof of the main result. The authors flatly assume that any algorithm for SAT must proceed by reducing an instance of size n to instances of size n-1 in a particular way.

The fact that the statement of the main result was also directly refuted 20 years ago just makes the whole thing extra silly."

How was it directly refuted 20 years ago and what are we actually talking about?

Finally i find it amusing that they keep quoting Chaitin. How does Chaitin feel about it?

So the authors succeeded in what they set out to do, engage. whether work is frivolous or not. they got their engagement. Congratulations you two.

Regarding the paragraph after "so back to Williams and Allender:"

The point that Ryan and I were attempting to make in our comment is the following (which I hope is obvious):

The statement of Theorem 3.2 claims that any algorithm that solves (their formulation of) the Constraint Satisfaction Problem requires time essentially d^n. This means that they must rule out the existence of ANY algorithm that solves CSP and has a smaller run time. It does NOT mean that they only need to rule out algorithms that use only a small amount of space. (If they could prove that, it would of course also be a fantastic result. But that's not what they claim, and it's not what they do.) It also does NOT mean that they only need to rule out algorithms that look just like the algorithms that we already know about. It's the algorithms that we DON'T know about that really need to be excluded. In our comment, Ryan and I pointed out that the argument that purports to prove Theorem 3.2 focuses only on algorithms that operate in a particular way, and we gave an example of an entire class of possible algorithms that are not addressed by their argument. (Namely, take the CSP instance, construct a graph from it, and look to see if it contains a particular kind of subgraph.)

In order to show that an argument is insufficient, it is not necessary to present an algorithm that beats the claimed lower bound. It doesn't matter that we don't think that this is a particularly promising class of algorithms: The point is that there is (still) no proof that an algorithm of this sort will not work.

But in fact we WERE able to point to an algorithm that beats their lower bound! The authors explicitly claim that their lower bound holds even in the case where k=2, and Ryan Williams published an algorithm 20 years ago whose runtime beats their claimed lower bound. So how can there be any additional discussion about whether their proof is correct?

Regarding "Can someone point out if they addressed this point?" They attempted to address this point, by pointing out that Ryan's algorithm uses quite a bit of space, and saying "Researchers do not include this type of algorithm in their discussions of exact algorithms for CSPs". Since Ryan's paper on this topic has more than 500 citations, this strikes me as a very dubious assertion.

The argument that "other algorithms might exist" feels analogous to claiming "aliens could exist in the universe".

In computational complexity, space efficiency is fundamentally more valuable than time efficiency—this is a well-established principle. Allender’s attempt to dismiss space-complexity concerns by citing paper references strikes me as equally unconvincing.

After reviewing all the comments, I'm left with the impression that certain participants seem resistant to the idea of P vs NP being resolved at all.

I in no way intended to dismiss space complexity concerns. You seem to have mis-read my statement. Instead, I was intending to dismiss the assertion that researchers don't consider the algorithm in [Williams] to be a CSP algorithm. Clearly, there are quite a few researchers who do consider it to be a CSP algorithm worthy of consideration. The citation count backs me up.

Regarding 'The argument that "other algorithms might exist" feels analogous to claiming "aliens could exist in the universe".':

Consider the linear programming problem. In the 1970's, it was not known whether there was a polynomial-time algorithm to solve linear programming. Even at that time, there had been decades of experience by a large community of practitioners and researchers, solving linear programming using variants of the simplex algorithm. One could imagine someone trying to show that there was NO polynomial-time algorithm, by observing that all known variants of the simplex algorithm had superpolynomial running time, and (with some justification, considering the community at that time) claiming that researchers did not consider non-simplex algorithms to be legitimate approaches to solving linear programming. But of course Khachiyan's breakthrough approach opened the eyes of the community to new approaches to linear programming. That is: an "other algorithm" really did exist.

It is an extremely important question, whether or not an "other" approach to CSP can exist. But it is not particularly interesting to simply show that "no CSP algorithm that looks exactly like the algorithms that we're currently using can run much faster".

hi @anon8:31PM: not sure this is a fair comparison. I think time efficiency is as core as space. So, while you might be pro paper, i feel you are missing out. Fair point goes to both though. If it took exponential space to solve, then fine, we might make a point like this ... at the same time then, would there be novel ways to reduce the space required (for Williams k=2 case). If so, I think any criticism from paper is not warranted. I will have to side pro Williams and Allender on this one.

I fully acknowledge the significance of Williams' algorithmic contribution. However, my primary concern lies in the fundamental dimensional incomparability between the two approaches. Xu’s framework—whether employing brute-force or non-brute-force strategies—operates strictly within polynomial space, whereas Williams’ non-brute-force algorithm inherently requires superpolynomial space. This divergence in space complexity places the two methods in fundamentally different computational regimes, rendering direct theoretical comparisons between them problematic.

I have read the paper, "SAT requires exhaustive search." ( I also strongly believe anyone who wants to make meaningful comments and arguments here should also read the paper at least once). 

 The authors argue that the most fundamental problem in computer science is the distinction between non-brute-force computation and brute-force computation, rather than P versus NP. In my view, this is the paper’s most significant point because it serves as the core motivation for their work and pertains to the strategic direction of computational complexity research.

The second most important point is the construction of self-referential instances, which illustrates what hard instances look like and why they are difficult to solve.

The least important point is the proof of the main result, as it directly employs the standard diagonalization method.

Regarding "The authors argue that the most fundamental problem in computer science is the distinction between non-brute-force computation and brute-force computation, rather than P versus NP":

I agree completely that the question about whether brute-force computation is required is fundamental.

This question has, in fact, received a GREAT DEAL of attention in the field of computational complexity theory. There is a significant literature regarding the “perebor conjecture”, going all the way back to the seminal work of Leonid Levin, and before), dealing precisely with the question of whether exhaustive search is required. (Interestingly, there is some surprising work showing that some formulations of the perebor conjecture are false. See [Mazor & Pass, ITCS 2024] and [Hirahara, Ilango, Williams; STOC 2024].) Work on the "Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis" also falls under the topic of whether brutue-force computation is required. This is certainly not a new question.

The parts of the paper that deal with the construction of self-referential instances would be much more interesting if they actually contributed to a correct proof of their Theorem 3.2. Unfortunately (as I've tried to explain elsewhere in this series of comments) no convincing proof of their Theorem 3.2 is in hand.

I have read this paper and my minor comment is that the "proof" is not, as claimed by the authors, a standard diagonalization. Refer to the paper Diagonal Arguments and Cartesian Closed Categories for I've read this paper, and my small comment is that this "proof" isn't a standard diagonalization, as the authors claim. For a standard construction of diagonalization, see the paper "Diagonal Arguments and Cartesian Closed Categories." This paper doesn't construct most of the structures that appear in proofs by Russell, Gödel, Cantor, and Turing. standard structure of diagonalization. Most of the structures present in Russell, Gödel, Cantor and Turing's proof are not constructed in this paper.

Yes, the issue of exhaustive search has been discussed before. However, by linking this problem to Gödel's work, the authors of the paper "SAT Requires Exhaustive Search"have endowed it with a brand-new significance. Furthermore, no one has explicitly pointed out that this problem is actually more fundamental than the better-known P vs. NP problem. 

A key aspect of Gödel's work lies in the construction of self-referential propositions. To demonstrate that such propositions are unprovable within finite formal systems, Gödel put forward assumptions regarding the nature of proof: a proof is a finite sequence of symbols, and the correctness of a proof can be verified mechanically. On this basis, Gödel's incompleteness theorem was proven using the diagonalization method. Similarly, in the paper "SAT Requires Exhaustive Search", the authors constructed self-referential CSP instances and proposed assumptions about how CSP instances are detremined to be satisfiable or unsatisfiable. They then employed the standard diagonalization method to prove their main result. Thus, the problem that requires discussion is not whether their simple and straightforward proof is correct, but whether we can replace the current assumption with a better one. In other words, there ought to be a bridge connecting self-referential instances to the diagonalization method. The question then becomes: can we construct a bridge that is better than the current one?

I don't know what to say. Are the authors saying we don't claim to have resolved PvsNP? but happy we resolved what we think matters most. So these folks are very practical computer science students. that is ok, then. they should go publish under that thesis.

Assuming we're addressing two distinct problems:

1. Is there a better algorithm than brute-force search to solve all Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)?

2. Is P equal to NP (P vs. NP)?

I definitely feel that problem (1) is more intuitive than problem (2). A potential solution to (1) would be to construct specific CPS instances that cannot be solved more efficiently than with a brute-force search. If such instances exist, the answer to problem (1) would be "no."

If the answer to problem (1) is no, this directly implies that P != NP. The existence of a CSP that requires brute-force search (which is exponential in time) means there's a problem in NP that can't be solved in polynomial time.

However, I also feel that problem (1) might be harder to formalize precisely than problem (2). One challenge, as other comments have pointed out, is the assumption that algorithms for CPS must be based on a "divide-and-conquer" approach. I assume this is the status quo for many existing exact algorithms for CPS.
