About
-----

[](https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend#about)

Octo is a small, helpful, cephalopod-flavored coding assistant that works with any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible LLM API, and allows you to switch models at will mid-conversation when a particular model gets stuck. Octo can optionally use (and we recommend using) ML models we custom-trained and open-sourced ([1](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/diff-apply), [2](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/fix-json)) to automatically handle tool call and code edit failures from the main coding models you're working with: the autofix models work with any coding LLM. Octo wants to help you because Octo is your friend.

Octo works great with GPT-5, Claude 4, GLM-4.5, and Kimi K2 (although you can use it with pretty much anything!). Correctly handling multi-turn responses, especially with thinking models like GPT-5 and Claude 4 (whose content may even be encrypted), can be tricky. Octo carefully manages thinking tokens to ensure it's always as smart as it can be. We think it's the best multi-LLM tool out there at managing thinking tokens, and you'll feel how much smarter it is.

Octo has zero telemetry. Using Octo with a privacy-focused LLM provider (may we selfishly recommend [Synthetic](https://synthetic.new/)?) means your code stays yours. But you can also use it with any OpenAI-compatible API provider, with Anthropic, or with local LLMs you run on your own machine.

Octo has helped write some of its own source code, but the codebase is human-first: Octo is meant to be a friendly little helper rather than a completely hands-free author, and that's how I use it. But if you want to live dangerously, you can always run `octofriend --unchained`, and skip all tool and edit confirmations.

Demo
----

[](https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend#demo)

[![Image 5: Octo asciicast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend/main/octo-asciicast.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/728456)

Rules
-----

[](https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend#rules)

Octo will look for instruction files named like so:

*   `OCTO.md`
*   `CLAUDE.md`
*   `AGENTS.md`

Octo uses the _first_ one of those it finds: so if you want to have different instructions for Octo than for Claude, just have an `OCTO.md` and a `CLAUDE.md`, and Octo will ignore your `CLAUDE.md`.

Octo will search the current directory for rules, and every parent directory, up until (inclusive of) your home directory. All rule files will be merged: so if you want project-specific rules as well as general rules to apply everywhere, you can add an `OCTO.md` to your project, as well as a global `OCTO.md` in your home directory.

If you don't want to clutter your home directory, you can also add a global rules file in `~/.config/octofriend/OCTO.md`.

Connecting Octo to MCP servers
------------------------------

[](https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend#connecting-octo-to-mcp-servers)

Octo can do a lot out of the box â pretty much anything is possible with enough Bash â but if you want access to rich data from an MCP server, it'll help Octo out a lot to just provide the MCP server directly instead of trying to contort its tentacles into crafting the right Bash-isms. After you run `octofriend` for the first time, you'll end up with a config file in `~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`. To hook Octo up to your favorite MCP server, add the following to the config file:

undefinedjs
mcpServers: {
  serverName: {
    command: "command-string",
    arguments: [
      "arguments",
      "to",
      "pass",
    ],
  },
},
undefined

For example, to plug Octo into your Linear workspace:

undefinedjs
mcpServers: {
  linear: {
    command: "npx",
    arguments: [ "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse" ],
  },
},
undefined
