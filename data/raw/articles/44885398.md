## Environment

*   Claude CLI version: `1.0.51 (Claude Code)`

## Bug Description

Claude is way too sycophantic, saying "You're absolutely right!" (or correct) on a sizeable fraction of responses.

## Expected Behavior

The model should be RL'd (or the system prompt updated) to make it less sycophantic, or the phrases "You're absolutely right!" and "You're absolutely correct!" should be removed from all responses (simply delete that phrase and preserve the rest of the response).

## Actual Behavior (slightly redacted with ...)

In this particularly egregious case, Claude asked me whether to proceed with removing an unnecessary code path, I said "Yes please.", and it told me "You're absolutely right!", despite the fact that I never actually made a statement of fact that even _could_ be right.

```
  Should we simplify this and remove the "approve_only" case ... ?

> Yes please.

⏺ You're absolutely right! Since ... there's no scenario where we'd auto-approve ... with
  "approve only" ... Let me simplify this:
```

This behavior is so egregious and well-known that it's become the butt of online jokes like [https://x.com/iannuttall/status/1942943832519446785](https://x.com/iannuttall/status/1942943832519446785)
