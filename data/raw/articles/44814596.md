The Multicians web site presents the story of the Multics operating system for people interested in the system's history, especially [Multicians](https://www.multicians.org/mgm.html#Multician "glossary: Anyone who contributed to the development and success of..."). The site's goals are to

*   preserve the technical ideas and advances of Multics so others don't need to reinvent them.
*   record the history of Multics, its builders, and its users before we all forget.
*   give credit where it's due for important innovations.
*   remember some good times and good people.

The Multicians web site contains 487 HTML files (see the [Site Map](https://www.multicians.org/sitemap.html "about: Site Map by Tom Van Vleck")) comprising over 540K lines, 1795 PDF files, and 670 graphic images. The site has benefited from the contributions of many authors. Contributions are invited: if you have a correction, fact, date, name, anecdote, or picture, please share it with Multicians everywhere by sending mail to the editor.

 The late Harry Reed and Charles Anthony reached a major milestone on the [Multics simulator](https://www.multicians.org/simulator.html "About the SIMH based simulator for the Honeywell 6180 (DPS8M).") on Saturday 08 November, 2014. Their [hardware simulator](https://www.multicians.org/multics-news.html#hreedsim "Current events involving Multics") booted Multics MR 12.5 software, came to operator command level, entered admin mode, created a small PL/I program, compiled and executed it, and shut down. [![Image 8](https://www.multicians.org/mulimg/tinyglob.gif)**DPS8M Simulator Release 3.1.0**](https://dps8m.gitlab.io/blog/posts/20250514_DPS8M_R3.1.0/ "new window: https://dps8m.gitlab.io/blog/posts/20250514_DPS8M_R3.1.0/") is now available. See the [![Image 9](https://www.multicians.org/mulimg/tinyglob.gif) Release Notes](https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m/-/wikis/DPS8M-R3.1.0-Release-Notes "new window: https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m/-/wikis/DPS8M-R3.1.0-Release-Notes"). There have been multiple updates to Multics software for the simulator: the latest version is [![Image 10](https://www.multicians.org/mulimg/tinyglob.gif)**MR 12.8, August 2023**](https://multics-wiki.swenson.org/ "new window: https://multics-wiki.swenson.org"). Anyone can try out a simulated Multics or install the simulator on their own computer.

**Multics** (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) was a mainframe time-sharing operating system begun in 1965 and used until 2000. Multics began as a research project and was an important influence on operating system development. The system became a commercial product sold by Honeywell to education, government, and industry.

Multics was a prototype of a [Computer Utility](https://www.multicians.org/mgc.html#computerutility "glossary: A computer, its software, and staff set up to..."), providing secure computing to remote users at their terminals. Multicians still miss the elegant, consistent, and powerful programming environment; some Multics features are only now being added to contemporary systems.
