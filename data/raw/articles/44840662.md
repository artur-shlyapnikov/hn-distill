Gold futures jump to record high after US tariffs on cast bars
==============================================================

Imposition of 39% import rate described as ‘another blow’ to Switzerland’s world-leading refining industry

The price of gold futures have soared to a record high after it emerged that the US would put tariffs on imports of 1kg bars in a further trade blow to [Switzerland](https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland), which dominates the world’s refining industry.

Swiss exports to the US were [hit by a crippling 39% tariff on Thursday](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/more-than-60-countries-scramble-respond-donald-trump-latest-tariffs) after the country’s president returned empty-handed from a last-minute dash to Washington in an attempt to get the rate, among the highest imposed by Donald Trump, lowered.

It later emerged that US customs had decided that certain imports of gold bars that had been in a tariff-exempt category should also be covered by the 39% rate.

The detail was revealed in a ruling letter – used by the US to clarify its trade policy – signed on 31 July and sent in response to a law firm’s request for clarification on the classification of gold for a New York precious metals trader and financier.

US Customs and Border Protection wrote back that 1kg and 100-ounce cast bars were not exempt from tariffs, adding: “Both types of bars are used primarily to back contracts on the Commodity Exchange (Comex), but are also sold to jewelers or industrial consumers for manufacturing purposes.”

Sales of gold from Switzerland to the US shot up in the first quarter of 2025 as investors sought refuge in a safe investment amid the uncertainty caused by Trump’s threat of tariffs.

The Swiss precious metals association suggested this trend may have contributed to Trump’s decision to slap a blanket 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland.

The association acknowledged “the short-term impact that gold has had on the trade balance at the beginning of 2025, which was an exceptional situation created by the reaction of the US markets to uncertainty around upcoming tariffs, and the global geopolitical situation”. It said the imposition of tariffs on gold cast products “makes it economically unviable to export them to the US”.

Its president, Christoph Wild, said: “We are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the US, a longstanding and historical partner for Switzerland.”

Record bullion exports of more than $36bn (£27bn) made up more than two-thirds of Switzerland’s trade surplus with the US in the first quarter, according to Swiss customs data.

The price of US gold futures hit an all-time intraday high of $3,534 on Friday after the details of the ruling letter, [first reported by the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/78be1315-608d-43c6-b8e7-80b9e18c5ce7), emerged.

With about 70% of the world market, Switzerland dominates the trade of turning gold from mines and other sources into gold bars.

It imports about 2,000 tonnes of gold annually, much of it from intermediary banks in London, New York and elsewhere, which are later exported as gold is seen as a safe haven investment at a time of financial uncertainty.

In the 12 months to June, Swiss exports of gold to the US were worth about $61.5bn and this now faces an extra levy of 39%. Switzerland’s rate is among the highest in the world, after Brazil, Syria, Laos and Myanmar.

According to reports, gold bars were in such demand in the US in May after Trump’s announcement of sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs the previous month that Costco capped how many gold bars could be bought in a day.

At this dangerous moment for dissent
------------------------------------

I hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, I wanted to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US.

When the military is deployed to quell overwhelmingly peaceful protest, when elected officials of the opposing party are arrested or handcuffed, when student activists are jailed and deported, and when a wide range of civic institutions – non-profits, law firms, universities, news outlets, the arts, the civil service, scientists – are targeted and penalized by the federal government, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that our core freedoms are disappearing before our eyes – and democracy itself is slipping away.

In any country on the cusp of authoritarianism, the role of the press as an engine of scrutiny, truth and accountability becomes increasingly critical. At the Guardian, we see it as our job not only to report on the suppression of dissenting voices, but to make sure those voices are heard.

Not every news organization sees its mission this way – indeed, some have been pressured by their corporate and billionaire owners to avoid antagonizing this government. I am thankful the Guardian is different.

Our only financial obligation is to fund independent journalism in perpetuity: we have no ultrarich owner, no shareholders, no corporate bosses with the power to overrule or influence our editorial decisions. Reader support is what guarantees our survival and safeguards our independence – and every cent we receive is reinvested in our work.

The Guardian’s global perspective helps contextualize and illuminate what we are experiencing in this country. That doesn’t mean we have a single viewpoint, but we do have a shared set of values. Humanity, curiosity and honesty guide us, and our work is rooted in solidarity with ordinary people and hope for our shared future.

**It has never been more urgent, or more perilous, to pursue reporting in the US that holds power to account and counters the spread of misinformation – and at the Guardian we make our journalism free and accessible to all. Can you spare just 37 seconds now to support our work and protect the free press?**

**We value whatever you can spare, but a recurring contribution makes the most impact, enabling greater investment in our most crucial, fearless journalism. As our thanks to you, we can offer you some great benefits – including seeing far fewer fundraising messages like this. We’ve made it very quick to set up, so we hope you’ll consider it. Thank you.**
