Published August 11, 2025 | Updated August 12, 2025

_\*\*\*updated on Aug. 11 at 11 a.m. (EST), with additional information about the Stack family\*\*\*_

WINDSOR, Wis. – [Bell Laboratories](https://www.belllabs.com) announced it has been acquired by [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). The transaction closed on July 31.

The acquisition marks a new chapter in Bell Laboratories’ history. Bell Laboratories said it remains committed to delivering high-quality products and services to customers worldwide. Under Berkshire Hathaway ownership, Bell will continue to operate independently, maintaining its leadership, culture and strategic direction.

Bell Laboratories welcomed Warren Buffett, Greg Abel, Howard Buffett and members of the Berkshire Hathaway team to its corporate headquarters Aug. 4. In a conversation between Bell President and CEO Steve Levy and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, Buffett congratulated the company on its 50-year legacy and offered his perspective on its future.

“Mr. Buffett congratulated Bell on 50 years of success,” Levy said. “He shared that, because of this transaction, Bell can expect to be around for the next 50 years.”

Patrick Lynch, chief commercial officer of Bell and president of Bell Sensing, said the company is excited to welcome Berkshire Hathaway to the pest control industry.

“Due to Berkshire’s commitment to maintaining our leadership and culture, we are happy to reassure our partners that Bell will continue to lead our industry, providing the widest breadth and highest quality rodent control tools on the market,” Lynch said.

Bell Laboratories was founded in 1974 by Malcolm Stack, who launched the business following a successful career managing a pesticide formulation business. Following his passing in 2006, the company had been solely owned by his daughters, Linda Hughes and Anne Connor, both of whom are now nearing retirement age. The sale to Berkshire Hathaway marks the first change of ownership from the Stack family.

Bell Laboratories said it remains committed to delivering innovative, science-driven rodent control solutions while upholding the values that have defined the company since its founding. Levy said, “We are grateful for the enduring commitment the Malcolm Stack family has made to the pest control industry, and we look forward to building on that legacy in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway.” 

**Early Reaction from Industry Distributors**  
PCT reached out to industry stakeholders and their reaction to the news Bell Laboratories had been sold to Berkshire Hathaway has been positive.  

Berkshire Hathaway, led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, is synonymous with the buy-and-hold investment strategy, holding investments for a long period of time.  
  
Tommy Reeves, vice president of distributor Oldham Chemicals Co., said he is optimistic about Bell Laboratories’ future because Berkshire Hathaway is a reputable investment firm with a solid track record. “It could’ve been acquired by other investors who might have quickly flipped the company, but Berkshire tends to take a longer-term approach. That gives me confidence in the future of Bell.”  
  
From a distributor perspective, Reeves does not expect any changes to product pricing and availability as well as quality control, innovation or R&D. “I expect a steady supply and consistency in the quality Bell Labs has maintained for the past 50 years,” he said.  
  
Reeves said it will be interesting to see if the Bell Laboratories acquisition will be a gateway to other pest control industry acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway. “Honestly, I’d welcome Berkshire acquiring other vendors. They seem like good people,” he said.  
  
Another industry distributor told PCT off the record he was not surprised by the announcement. “Investors continue to look for investments with a solid return, and that is not lost on Berkshire Hathaway,” he said. “The rodent category continues to grow and grow.”  
  
He added that “Bell Labs is a ‘well run machine’ with ‘outstanding people.’”
