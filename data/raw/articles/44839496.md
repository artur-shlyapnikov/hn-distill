Byte Buddy - runtime code generation for the Java virtual machine        

Byte Buddy

Byte Buddy is a code generation library for creating Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and without the help of a compiler. Other than the code generation utilities that [ship with the Java Class Library](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html), Byte Buddy allows the creation of arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for the creation of runtime proxies.
