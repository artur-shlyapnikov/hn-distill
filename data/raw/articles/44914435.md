A court in Hamburg, Germany, has stated in the details of a ruling concerning a Karl Marx reading group that Marx’s teachings may be contrary to the “free democratic basic order.”

On April 8, the “Marxist School of Politics and Culture Forum” (Masch) won its case against the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV) in the Hamburg Administrative Court.

The court ruled that the authorities could no longer classify the Hamburg-based association as “left-wing extremist.” Masch had won its lawsuit against its inclusion in the organization’s 2021 report and the revocation of its non-profit status in the same year.

**Lack of ‘active militant attitude’ saved a Marx association, but…**

Now, as [reported](https://taz.de/Klage-der-Marxistischen-Abendschule/!6101920/) by _taz_, it has emerged that this legal victory could backfire like a boomerang and pose a danger to all Marx reading circles in Germany.

The reason for this lies in what the Hamburg court wrote in its written decision on July 10. It is a common practice for courts to explain the precise reasons for their decisions in writing only weeks later, but the content of the decision is considered surprising.

The court affirmed its ruling in favor of Masch, declaring its inclusion in the constitutional protection report unlawful. However, it did so because its members lacked the “active militant attitude” to actually harm the constitution.

**Court rules Marx is incompatible with the ‘free democratic basic order’**

Masch has been active since 1981. It is best known in Hamburg for its annual reading groups on the first volume of Marx’s work _Capital_, but the group also publishes books and frequently organizes discussion events, often at the University of Hamburg.

It sees itself in the tradition of workers’ educational associations and Marxist workers’ schools and, by its own account, exhibits a “non-dogmatic and critical approach to Marxist theory.”

The association was deemed suspicious by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution because, among other things, it was alleged that Masch was originally founded by the German Communist Party (DKP) and still maintains close ties with it.

The court rejected this accusation in April, noting that only one of the 26 Masch members is currently a member of the DKP.

However, the written justification goes even further. The court discusses the issue of whether engaging with Marxist theory is fundamentally compatible with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The court finds that “the plaintiff’s activities, which focus on the theories of Karl Marx, are fundamentally incompatible with the free democratic basic order.”

The court states that the centrality of Marx’s works and teachings to Masch’s activities is evident from its name, “Marxist Evening School.”

According to the court, the reason this is problematic is as follows: “The social theory created by Marx may contain incompatibilities in fundamental points with the principles of the free democratic basic order.”

The court had not yet touched upon this point in its oral ruling in April.

**Danger for all Marx reading groups**

Ridvan Ciftci, the lawyer who represented Masch in court, finds the court’s statements “irresponsible.”

According to him, this decision implies that predominantly reading Marx is fundamentally unconstitutional. In Masch’s case, the group is not problematic only because it is “sufficiently insignificant” and not “actively militant.”

In Ciftci’s assessment, this poses a threat to all Marx reading circles in Germany. “Any association that primarily refers to Marx could therefore become a subject of surveillance,” the lawyer says.

In this respect, the decision in which Masch successfully defended itself against being classified as unconstitutional potentially appears to be a boomerang and, at the very least, a legal setback.

In fact, other courts have recently taken a much more flexible approach to the theory of Karl Marx. For example, in the case brought by the newspaper _Junge Welt_ against its surveillance by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the Berlin Administrative Court stated that a Marxist orientation alone does not constitute an effort to overthrow the free democratic basic order and that revolution could be a “radical, yet still constitutional social transformation.”

The Hamburg court, however, looks at the matter from a different perspective. The court believes that the Marxist theory adopted by Masch aims not just for reforms but for revolution through violence.

The court does not accept Masch’s objection that its discussions are limited to a critique of capitalism. Quoting from the association’s website, the court notes that the association’s goal is to “completely transform the economic system, the state, and society.”

**The main problem is the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’**

The court believes that when it comes to Marx, the problem lies in the concept of the “dictatorship of the proletariat.”

The court points out that the meaning of this concept “inevitably excludes other population groups from the political decision-making process and the indirect exercise of state power,” stating, in other words, that the dictatorship of the proletariat is “undemocratic.”

Masch member Michael Hopp argues that “this is a complete misunderstanding.” “The court is acting as if Marx’s texts were written yesterday,” says Hopp, who claims that Marx can “absolutely be understood as a democrat” when one does not solely refer to the _Communist Manifesto_ pamphlet, as the court does, and that the “older Marx” emphasized that the means of change must be adapted to the historical situation.

“Marx would have recommended anything but a crowd of people storming the Bundestag today,” says Hopp.

Hopp also suggests that the court misunderstands the nature of Marx’s theory as an “analytical tool” and of Masch as “an educational institution.” “The oversimplification lies in us being accused of putting words into action. But we look at the words and reflect on them,” he says.

**Is capitalism enshrined in the Basic Law?**

The decision of the Hamburg Administrative Court also touches on a problem that has been more frequently discussed in recent years following the demand to “expropriate Deutsche Wohnen & Co.”: To what extent does the Basic Law, the source of the free democratic basic order, stipulate that the Federal Republic of Germany should be organized according to capitalist principles?

The Hamburg court did not find Masch’s argument, which referred to political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth, that the Basic Law is neutral in terms of economic policy, to be convincing.

On the other hand, according to _taz_, many questions still remain unanswered:

_“Is every introductory course on Marx in the first semester now suspect? What exactly does ‘actively militant’ mean? Is radical social criticism not unconstitutional? To clarify these and other questions, Masch, which is currently considering appealing the decision, plans to do what it does best: organize a discussion event.”_

The deep and long-standing ties between German arms manufacturers and the Israeli military [will continue](https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/merzs-partial-arms-export-ban-wont-dent-germany-israel-defence-links) despite Berlin’s decision to partially block arms sales to Tel Aviv.

Several high-value exports, including submarines and naval corvettes, are reportedly exempt from the ban, which only covers weapons likely to be used in Gaza.

Germany’s imports from Israel, including a major deal for the purchase of Arrow-3 missile defense systems, will also be unaffected.

“This is unlikely to affect the defense industry relations between Israel and Germany in the long term,” said Zain Hussain, an arms export expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which monitors the global arms trade.

Germany is Israel’s second-largest supplier of “major weapons” after the US, and Hussain said, “Israel will continue to rely on these countries for most of its significant weapons capabilities.”

**Merz’s restrictions ‘deliberately limited’**

An unanswered question is whether shipments of German-made engines, transmissions, and spare parts for Israeli armored vehicles, which are widely used in Gaza and the West Bank, will continue.

A German government spokesperson declined to answer questions about tank parts on Monday, stating that each case would be evaluated individually.

Engine manufacturer MTU, reportedly among the suppliers, announced that it would comply with export control rules in the countries where it operates but would not comment on possible exports to Israel.

Muriel Asseburg, an Israel expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), said that Merz’s restrictions were deliberately limited in scope and duration and therefore unlikely to have a long-term impact on defense relations, but added, “A partial embargo by Israel’s second-largest arms supplier still sends a message.”

**German arms companies say they have not yet received information from the government**

German defense industry players also remain in the dark on the matter. Hans Christoph Atzpodien, head of the German defense industry lobby group BDSV, told Euractiv on Monday that they “have no information beyond what is publicly available.”

Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, which produces naval vessels for Israel, also said they “have not received any official information from the federal government.”

According to SIPRI, Israel’s Sa’ar 6 naval corvettes, built in part by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, are being used to strike targets in Gaza.

In an internal document addressing criticism from within his own CDU party, Merz said the ban would not apply to “air and sea defense equipment vital for Israel’s self-defense.”

**Approval for 251 million euros in arms exports to Israel since the beginning of 2024**

Details about Germany’s arms exports are largely confidential, and export licenses are secretly approved by Germany’s cabinet-level national security council. Apart from semi-annual figures on the total export value of defense products, very little information is officially disclosed.

Following the October 7 Al-Aqsa Flood operation, Germany granted arms export licenses to Israel worth approximately 326 million euros in 2023 after an expedited approval process. This figure is nearly ten times that of the previous year. In 2024, another 161 million euros were approved.

According to Ministry of Economy data, Germany exported approximately 90 million euros worth of weapons to Israel in the first half of 2025.

According to information obtained by Die Linke (The Left Party) through a parliamentary inquiry, the shipments included firearms, ammunition, weapon parts, special army and navy equipment, electronic devices, and special armored vehicles.

Asseburg said that it is not entirely clear from publicly available information which German-made weapons are being used directly in Gaza, but that even equipment used elsewhere enables Israel to use other weapons in its military operations.

She said that Germany’s deliveries of “corvettes, anti-tank weapons, mechanical parts for armored vehicles, armored vehicle ammunition, small arms, and small arms ammunition” are “important for Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip.”

Asseburg also added that Israel’s “extreme dependence on US arms deliveries and financing” means that the decisions of US President Donald Trump are “decisive” in influencing Israel’s behavior.

**Renk threatens to move production out of Germany**

German defense industry company Renk has threatened to move part of its production abroad to continue selling parts for Israeli tanks following Berlin’s announcement of an export embargo.

The head of the Bavaria-based group, which produces transmissions for Israeli tanks and armored vehicles, said it is their “responsibility” to ensure the country “maintains its deterrence capability.”

CEO Alexander Sagel [told](https://www.ft.com/content/c5f1de08-8e7d-4703-810c-085c40e9af42) the _Financial Times_ (FT) that Renk is still trying to understand the consequences of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s announcement last week that he would suspend the sale of military products that could be used in Gaza.

Sagel stated that as a German company, Renk will comply with the country’s laws and regulations.

However, he added that the company, which has a market value of 6.3 billion euros, is considering other ways to fulfill its contracts if the ban is approved by Germany’s security council.

Sagel had previously told analysts that 2% to 3% of Renk’s sales are to Israel. “It is also clear that we are discussing a Plan B. Plan B is to move the production of these specific transmissions to the US,” Sagel said.

**CEO Sagel: It is our responsibility to maintain Israel’s deterrence**

When asked about the moral aspect of supplying tank parts to Israel, which is accused of widespread human rights violations, Sagel claimed it is a “difficult discussion.”

Sagel added, “Of course, we are following all the discussions regarding the Gaza Strip. But from Germany’s perspective, it is our responsibility to ensure that Israel maintains its deterrent power. This power is necessary not only in Gaza but also on other borders.”

Sagel declined to disclose the number of transmissions Renk is supposed to deliver to Israel but told analysts that the company is contracted to supply “hundreds” of products.

On Wednesday, Renk reported that its revenues for the first half of 2025 rose by 22% to 620 million euros compared to the same period last year, benefiting from an increase in defense spending in Europe. Adjusted profit before interest and taxes rose by 29% to 89 million euros.

Sagel said that if the embargo continues, it will affect Renk’s operating profit in the second half of the year by several million euros.

Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall, one of the continent’s largest defense companies, told the _FT_ that his company, which produces a variety of products including tank ammunition, does not export any weapons to Israel.

# UK police instructed to release suspect ethnicity in high-profile cases

Police forces in England [have been instructed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/08/13/police-to-reveal-ethnicity-of-suspects-after-cover-up-claim/) to share the ethnicity and nationality of suspects, following accusations that authorities were covering up crimes committed by asylum seekers.

Interim guidance published by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing stated that police forces should consider disclosing additional details about suspects accused in particularly “high-profile and sensitive” investigations.

Typically, when a suspect is arrested, police forces in England and Wales only disclose the person’s age and the location of the arrest.

This decision was made after two men were charged in Warwickshire last month for the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton.

Ahmad Mulakhil, 23, was charged with rape earlier this month, while Mohammad Kabir, also 23, appeared in court on charges of kidnapping and strangulation.

George Finch, the 19-year-old Reform UK leader on Warwickshire County Council, claimed the two accused men were asylum seekers from Afghanistan, prompting Nigel Farage to say the crime was being covered up.

Warwickshire Police previously responded by saying it “does not and will not cover up such crimes” but confirmed it would “not disclose the immigration status” of the suspects.

The issue of disclosing suspects’ ethnicity also played a role in the riots that occurred last summer. Following the Southport murders, Merseyside Police faced heavy criticism for not providing information about the perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana. Misinformation had spread regarding the murder, including false claims that Rudakubana was a Muslim asylum seeker.

It is hoped that the guidance change, which takes effect immediately, will prevent the spread of misinformation on social media.

Deputy Chief Constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC’s lead for ethics, said:

“We have seen during the disorder last summer and in a few high-profile incidents more recently the very real-world consequences of the information police do and do not release to the public.

In an age of social media speculation and information being able to spread through a variety of channels at an incredible speed, we must ensure our processes are fit for purpose.

Misinformation and disinformation can spread in a vacuum. It is good policing for us to fill that vacuum with facts in the public interest.”

In May, Merseyside Police disclosed the ethnicity of the driver of a car that drove into a crowd during Liverpool FC’s Premier League victory celebrations just a few hours after his arrest.

Seeking to prevent unrest, police announced just two hours after the incident that the suspect was a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area.

The new guidance follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s request in March for the Law Commission to fast-track new contempt of court rules to allow more information about suspects to be released.

# Right-wing AfD becomes Germany’s most popular party in new poll

According to a new poll [published](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-far-right-afd-lead-survey/) on Tuesday, the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become the most popular party in the country.

According to the poll conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis, if a federal election were held now, 26% of Germans would vote for the AfD.

This result places the party ahead of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, led by Friedrich Merz, which fell to second place with 24% support in the poll.

In a context where Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) is also leading by a clear margin in France, this poll in Germany is likely to increase unease among mainstream European leaders.

Right-wing parties have shown strong electoral performances in recent years, from Poland and Romania to Portugal and the Netherlands.

In the United Kingdom, Nigel Farage’s party, Reform UK, is also topping the polls due to widespread public dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party government.

However, according to _POLITICO_‘s aggregate of voter polls, Germany’s conservative Christian Democrats maintain a slight lead over the AfD.

The AfD’s support has continued to climb since the last federal election, with polling figures reaching nearly 21% in February, marking a significant increase. The AfD is currently the largest opposition party in the Federal Parliament.

The AfD was founded over a decade ago as a single-issue party by a group of economics professors who opposed the euro and financial aid to indebted countries during Europe’s debt crisis.

In its early years, it regularly achieved single-digit results in federal and state elections.

Currently led by Alice Weidel, a former Goldman Sachs executive, the AfD maintains a staunchly anti-immigration stance.

Some mainstream politicians argue that the party is “extremist” and should be banned under provisions in the German constitution designed to prevent a recurrence of the country’s Nazi past.

The Forsa poll also indicated that Merz is facing growing trouble on the domestic front, partly due to his focus on foreign policy issues such as the war in Ukraine and Europe’s relations with the US under President Donald Trump.

According to the poll, a majority of Germans are dissatisfied with Merz’s performance, with 67% stating they are “dissatisfied” with him.

The next federal election is scheduled for 2025.
