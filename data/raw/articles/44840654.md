Efrit - AI-Powered Emacs Coding Assistant
=========================================

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#efrit---ai-powered-emacs-coding-assistant)

_A sophisticated AI coding agent that leverages Emacs' native programmability through direct Elisp evaluation._

Overview
--------

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#overview)

Efrit is a conversational AI assistant that integrates seamlessly with Emacs, providing multiple interfaces for different types of tasks:

*   **efrit-chat** - Multi-turn conversational interface for complex discussions and code development
*   **efrit-do** - Natural language command execution for quick tasks
*   **efrit** - Command interface for structured interactions
*   **efrit-agent-run** - Advanced agent loop for multi-step automation

Key Features
------------

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#key-features)

*   **Direct Elisp Evaluation**: Leverages Emacs' native programmability without complex abstractions
*   **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintains context across multiple exchanges with configurable turn limits
*   **Tool Integration**: Can execute Emacs functions, manipulate buffers, and interact with the environment
*   **Safety-First Design**: Confirmation systems and comprehensive error handling
*   **Dark Theme Friendly**: Adaptive colors that work with any Emacs theme

undefined

Usage
-----

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#usage)

### Available Commands

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#available-commands)

*   **`M-x efrit-chat`** - Multi-turn conversational interface
*   **`M-x efrit-do`** - Natural language command execution
*   **`M-x efrit`** - Command interface
*   **`M-x efrit-agent-run`** - Advanced agent loop

### Key Bindings

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#key-bindings)

*   `C-c C-e e` - efrit-chat
*   `C-c C-e d` - efrit-do
*   `C-c C-e c` - efrit command interface
*   `C-c C-e a` - efrit-agent-run

### Examples

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#examples)

#### Visual Demonstrations

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#visual-demonstrations)

**Multi-Buffer Creation with efrit-do**

Starting with a simple request:

```
M-x efrit-do
> write an ode in one buffer, and a sonnet in another, both about Vim
```

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit/blob/main/ode-sonnet-vim.jpg)

**Conversational Context - Making Modifications**

efrit-do maintains context, so you can refine previous work:

```
M-x efrit-do  
> Can you make them more snarky?
```

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit/blob/main/ode-sonnet-snarky.jpg)

This demonstrates efrit-do's key feature: **conversational continuity**. It remembers what it just created and can modify, improve, or completely rewrite previous work based on your feedback.

#### More Usage Examples

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#more-usage-examples)

**Conversational Development**:

```
M-x efrit-chat
> Can you help me write a function to count lines in the current buffer?
> Now modify it to exclude empty lines and comments
```

**Quick Commands**:

```
M-x efrit-do
> open the scratch buffer and insert "hello world"
> find all TODO comments in the current project
```

**Multi-step Tasks**:

```
M-x efrit-chat
> Create a haiku in one buffer and a limerick in another buffer
```

Architecture
------------

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#architecture)

### Core Philosophy

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#core-philosophy)

Efrit follows the principle of **Elisp-centricity**: rather than building complex tool abstractions, it provides the AI with direct access to Emacs' powerful Elisp evaluation capabilities. This approach offers unlimited flexibility while staying within Emacs' natural paradigm.

### Core Components

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#core-components)

*   **efrit.el** - Main entry point and package coordination
*   **efrit-chat.el** - Multi-turn conversational interface with Claude API
*   **efrit-do.el** - Natural language command interface
*   **efrit-multi-turn.el** - Multi-turn conversation state management
*   **efrit-tools.el** - Core functionality engine with Elisp evaluation
*   **efrit-debug.el** - Optional debugging and logging system
*   **efrit-agent.el** - Advanced agent loop for complex automation

Troubleshooting
---------------

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#troubleshooting)

### Common Issues

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#common-issues)

**"Cannot open load file: efrit"**

*   Verify the path in your `load-path` is correct
*   Ensure `efrit.el` exists in that directory

**"API key not found"**

*   Check `~/.authinfo` file exists and has correct format
*   Test with: `M-x auth-source-search RET machine api.anthropic.com RET`

**Connection timeout**

*   Check internet connection and API key validity
*   Try increasing `efrit-api-timeout`

### Debug Mode

[](https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit#debug-mode)

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

undefinedemacs
(setq efrit-debug-enabled t)
undefined

Then check: `M-x efrit-debug-show`
