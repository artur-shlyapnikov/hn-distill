The BLS Can’t Be Replaced by the Private Sector
===============================================

Government statistical agencies provide breadth and context that private firms can’t match.

August 8, 2025 at 9:00 AM UTC

Claudia Sahm is the chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Federal Reserve economist. She is the creator of the Sahm rule, a recession indicator.

The data is sound.

Wall Street [may be worried](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-05/trump-throws-a-2-trillion-market-into-doubt-with-one-firing-evening-briefing?sref=EP6bV7CS) about President Donald Trump politicizing government economic statistics, but not everyone agrees he was wrong [to fire](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-02/trump-fires-data-chief-on-bad-job-news-gets-chance-to-tilt-fed) the BLS commissioner. “I probably would have fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics too,” the billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio [wrote on X](https://x.com/RayDalio/status/1952383144218288460). He did not accuse her of rigging the jobs numbers to make Republicans look bad, as Trump did, but Dalio called the BLS process “obviously obsolete and error-prone.” The private sector, he said, could do the job better.

No, and no. The BLS is constantly [modernizing](https://www.bls.gov/blog/2024/the-importance-of-equitable-and-timely-access-to-data.htm#:~:text=Over%20the%20course%20of%20my,equitable%20access%20to%20our%20data.) its methods, and private companies cannot replace the BLS or any other US statistical agency.

Private companies are in the business of making a profit, and to do that they need to attract customers. Some customers are more profitable than others. As a result, a company’s data will tend to reflect the needs of its clients — it won’t capture the economy as whole.

That’s the job of government statistical agencies, whose surveys are designed to be representative. In fact, the private sector uses them to create economic statistics from its own data — and when the government uses private-sector data, which it does, it takes pains to put them in the context of the broader economy.

When I was at the US Federal Reserve, I [worked](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26253/w26253.pdf) with a team of economists and engineers on project using data from Fiserv, the financial services and technology firm. The goal was to transform its data on card transactions into a daily, geographically detailed report on retail sales. We used the spending shares by industry and geography in the Census Bureau’s economic census to reweight the company data and make them representative of the US. Even high-quality economic statistics from private companies need to be augmented by government statistics.

Private company data are not comprehensive. The BLS publishes statistics on employment, productivity and inflation. There is no existing private company with data that covers such a range. [ADP](https://adpemploymentreport.com/), the private company that Dalio referenced, provides monthly estimates of private-sector payrolls in 10 industries. The BLS reports employment figures for more than 100 industries and multiple levels of government, as well as data on hours and wages. Among households, it estimates the unemployment rate, labor participation rate and other statistics with demographic detail.

Private-sector statistics like ADP’s — or Fiserv’s — are a useful complement, and government statistics increasingly use private-sector data. But the private sector cannot match the breadth of the government effort.

To be clear, this is the way it should be: Private companies are not in the business of creating public goods, which is what economic statistics from the government are. They are free to users, transparent in their methods, protective of the privacy of individuals and businesses, and dependable. Most private companies that create statistics charge users for access. (Some share their results publicly as a form of marketing.) Many private companies share only limited information about their methodology to deter competition.

And even when the private sector collects comprehensive and transparent data, there’s no guarantee that it will continue to do so. For many firms that create statistics, the effort is a sidebar to their main business. They could change their priorities or go out of business. Continuity is important in economic statistics, some of which are used in private-sector contracts, as the Consumer Price Index is used to set Social Security benefits.

If it’s not profitable, a private company will just stop producing statistics. Government statistical agencies work in the public interest.

Dalio is right that BLS should continue to innovate. But he is incorrect that it lacks a strategic vision on how to modernize. US statistical agencies have been modernizing their statistics since their founding. Countless researchers at statistical agencies have identified and implemented changes, including on how to use private company data to improve [BLS data](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c14280/c14280.pdf).

What the agencies need is more funding from the government and closer partnerships with the private sector. Instead, the administration [has disbanded](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-03-11/the-war-on-government-statistics-has-quietly-begun?sref=EP6bV7CS) an advisory committee designed help make economic statistics timelier and more accurate. And it has proposed to cut the [BLS’s budget](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-04/trump-budget-calls-for-bls-cuts-raising-data-quality-concerns), which has been flat for years, by 8%.

Instead of firing the commissioner, the president should be giving the agency a raise in the form of a bigger budget. The goal should be to restore public trust in government statistics, not undermine it.
