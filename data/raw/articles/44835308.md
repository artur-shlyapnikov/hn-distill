Thanks. Never looked at that page. Modifying .zip files by sqiite is quite funny :-)

[@jpmens](https://mastodon.social/@jpmens "@jpmens")[@gereon](https://mastodon.social/@gereon@chaos.social "@gereon@chaos.social") This is because of UNIX, where everything is a file (check?: ) and tools can do 1 thing and that very well (chec… eehhhh? …).

Processing a single-file encoding of a database is not technically different from processing a compressed archive: the second is just a very specific use case for the first. It's just a matter of interface.

Want it to be MORE Unix? implement both sqlite3 and zip as interfaces to an underlying single-file relational database manipulation library (applies to ALL file formats).

So a ZIP file on a filesystem is like a MySQL blob within a PostgreSQL table.

Change my mind.

[@jpmens](https://mastodon.social/@jpmens "@jpmens") So can I query a SQLite database from the result of a bytes lookup of another query? E.g. a file stored in a ZIP?
