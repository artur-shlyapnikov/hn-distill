is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Perplexity has just offered to buy Google Chrome for $34.5 billion — a bid that’s far more than the AI search startup itself is valued at, according to reports [from _The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/tech/perplexity-makes-longshot-34-5-billion-offer-for-chrome-5ddb7a22?mod=tech_lead_story) and [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/perplexity-makes-34-5-billion-bid-for-google-s-chrome-browser). The startup sent the unsolicited bid on Tuesday, just months after [Perplexity said it would buy Chrome](/policy/654835/perplexity-google-antitrust-trial-remedies-chrome) if the government [forces Google to sell its browser](/2024/11/27/24302415/doj-google-search-antitrust-remedies-chrome-android).

The startup [also offered to buy TikTok](/ai-artificial-intelligence/633973/perplexity-tiktok-bid) earlier this year. Google hasn’t indicated that it would sell Chrome at any price, and so far, the court hasn’t ordered a sale.

Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer confirmed to _The Verge_ that the _WSJ_’s reporting is accurate. The startup’s bid for Chrome stands in stark contrast to the startup’s [valuation of about $18 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/ai-startup-perplexity-valued-at-18-billion-with-new-funding).

Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s chief business officer, told _Bloomberg_ that “multiple large investment funds have agreed to finance the transaction in full.” A spokesperson for the startup also told _Bloomberg_ that Perplexity would invest more than $3 billion in Chrome and Chromium over the next two years if Google accepts the deal.
