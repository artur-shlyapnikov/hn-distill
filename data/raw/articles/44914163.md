As PayPal disappears for some Steam users around the world, Valve continues grappling with external pressures

# Steam can't escape the fallout from its censorship controversy

If you recently tried to purchase a game on Steam, perhaps you noticed that you can no longer use PayPal as remittance. It's not a temporary bug, but another consequence of [Steam's ongoing battle](https://www.polygon.com/visa-mastercard-steam-censorship-valve-itchio-gta/?) with [payment processors like Visa and Mastercard](https://www.polygon.com/news/615910/itchio-steam-sex-adult-games-delisting-pulled-vice-controversy/).

[In a quote provided to Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries), Valve clarified that the disappearance of PayPal is related to offering specific types of "content on Steam," much like the issue "surrounding Mastercard."

"In this case, one of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," a rep said.

PayPal isn't gone for everyone; I just tried checking out a game, and could log into PayPal just fine. As of early July, the currencies that can still use PayPal on Steam include EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. While this means many major currencies still have the option, this change will likely affect a lot of people around the world.

PayPal has also pulled out of some parts of Steam despite the platform's decision to delist a wide swath of adult-oriented games. That crackdown was due to pressure from payment processors and an anti-violence against women group called Collective Shout, which has organized campaigns to limit the sales of series like Grand Theft Auto. Amid all of these actions, payment processors insist that if the product is legal, they do not tell vendors what they can or cannot sell. Valve, however, has said that the encouragement to reconsider what types of games it sells has come from intermediaries like banks, seemingly speaking on behalf of payment processors. Whatever the case, Valve's rules for platforming a game now vaguely state that the content must follow rules set forth by payment processors. The snafu has also affected other platforms like Itchio, as well as games that merely include mature themes. Steam's acquiescence to these external pressures has also led to [a gamer-led movement to harass payment processors](https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/), if not a widespread sense of unease over the wider ramifications of the censorship.

The increased scrutiny around adult games also coincides with a wider push for [age verification measures on websites like YouTube](https://www.ign.com/articles/youtubes-new-ai-age-verification-system-goes-into-effect-today-in-the-united-states) and Pornhub. If the internet at large continues to tamp down on the full spectrum of "adult content" and a person's actual identity becomes fully tied to your online presence, the possibilities for complications could become exponential.

Valve's hoping to restore PayPal for everyone, but cannot say when it might be back. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this," the Valve rep said. "In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."

    Purity culture is starting to get out of control to the point it's starting to effect the world at large instead of just the communities those people belong to. When I was much younger I thought it was organized religion that caused things to get so heavy handed with keeping things chaste, but I see now there are just people out there who can't help but enforce their values on others if they have the means to do so.

    Most, if not all, of these people are also highly invested in their chosen religion, so your idea of organized religion being to blame is still entirely valid.

    @Aaron, the difference is that one moral standing limits people based off what they view as acceptable, whereas this guy's moral standing does not. His is neutral because it doesnt force people to follow his views. They have the choice to make use of something or not. While there's is "you arent allowed to make that choice because we dont like there being a choice."

    @Solanna That actually doesn't answer the question. Is it your view that explicit content should be allowed in public spaces, and it’s each person’s job to avoid it if they don’t like it (which means your standard is being applied to everyone). Or do you believe public spaces should have no shared standards at all — in which case, how would you object to anything being displayed anywhere?

    @Solanna At a minimum, you and this guy are forcing me to follow your views. What I want is to push fringe behavior to the fringes of society. You (and this guy) say I should not be allowed to do that. So, according to your definition, you (and this guy) are not neutral.

    You’re framing “purity culture” as biased and your own “anything goes” view as neutral, but that’s still a moral framework. Do you believe your view of what’s acceptable in public should be the standard everyone else follows (so your standard is what’s forced on everyone)? Or do you have no moral framework at all for what should or shouldn’t be allowed (in which case, how could you call anyone’s view “out of control”)?

    This is out of hand. PARENTS need to be held accountable for monitoring what their children have access to, not other companies monitoring it through censorship. Gaming platforms should be allowed to sell what they want. It's up to the consumer to decide whether to consume that content or not. And parents need to do a better job at monitoring what their children are exposed to. This is not the responsibility of the gaming platforms.

    This is bad reporting. The lobby group is only anti-violence against women in name only. It is a radicalized religious puritan group. Time to call it out as such.

    PayPal is owned by a bunch of evil ppl so that tracks. Steam not trying hard enough to “escape” the controversy.

    Ah yes, "protecting children", the historical means of censorship.

    "As of early July, the currencies that can still use PayPal on Steam include EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. While this means many major currencies still have the option, this change will likely affect a lot of people around the world."
    
      
    
    So most Asian markets will have an issue, although it should be noted that China is using a sanitized version of Steam, and that the rest of southeast Asia by and large hasn't adopted it widely yet. We're left with LATAM and African markets, which I can't imagine are huge because LATAM already has a vibrant secondhand market that doesn't need Steam.
    
      
    
    "many major currencies still have the option" is right - It's probably 90% of their market.
    
      
    
    I'm not saying censorship isn't an issue, but this is FAR from being the "We won't be able to buy games anymore" crisis you're making it out to be.

    I'm all for "protecting children", of course, but it's pretty funny that the people groups pushing protections, like this in this way, also tend to have issues withe gubmints and privacy and their personal information. So, how they think things will reconcile between age restrictions and proving your age will probably be a pretty hilarious dissonance.

    Can't remember the last time "protect the children" _wasn't_ a dogwhistle for censorship. Every single time it's been pushed further to try and eliminate certain content altogether. More often than not, content from or about queer folks.

    Polygon, how about an article interviewing people this bothers as to why they play adult games in the first place? They’re not my cup of tea but I’m still intrigued by this gaming sub culture.
    
      
    
    Id be interested to know why it’s ok to restrict things IRL but somehow the internet has gone too far.

    Because it's not some religious group's business to control what LEGAL games I play, books I read, videos I watch, or websites I visit.

    You sound like a member of collective shout? I know they probably have people frequent these websites looking for targets and info.
    
      
    
    Your statement makes zero sense. Sounded smug tbh. Sadly, I guess you missed the boat. It's about censorship. The story ISNT about some weird shmuck who likes bad games and gooning. Why the F would you want to read about that? It's about censorship, and overt control.
    
      
    
    Those things aren't OK in real life either. Censorship and control. Unless the content was illegal. I suppose for some weak minded wastes of flesh, controlling your narrative is OK. You one of them?

    Not sure why it's not obvious, but the reason it's okay to restrict things in real life and not in art is because in art real people aren't being harmed. Expressing things like that in art is a form of free speech and can be done for many intended purposes including as a form of protest against or disagreement with the oppressive, harmful, or violent activity being depicted. It seems that recently activist groups have somehow decided that any artistic depiction of something they don't agree with is by default an endorsement and should be censored.
    
      
    
    They mention wanting to limit Grand theft Auto because there was a POTENTIAL in that series of games for violence against women. Well, there is a potential for mass mrdr in Skyrim. You can basically go into a village and off everyone. Mrdr is illegal too, so should Skyrim be censored as well just in case? Come to think of it Shakespeare had some very questionable stuff as well. Slippery slope arguments are often a fallacy but in this case it doesn't seem too much of a stretch

    Mainstream news always takes one viewpoint and runs. You will never get the view of the pro-censorship side.
    
      
    
    They quoted scientific studies showing the harmful affects yet people chalk it up to them being prudes and wanting to stop free speech.
    
      
    
    In reality games like that actually hurt you.
    
      
    
    I agree with the pro-censorship side after doing research on their position due to the bad mental affects of internet and game x rated content.
