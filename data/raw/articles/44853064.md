Abogen is a powerful text-to-speech conversion tool that makes it easy to turn ePub, PDF, or text files into high-quality audio with matching subtitles in seconds. Use it for audiobooks, voiceovers for Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, or any project that needs natural-sounding text-to-speech, using [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M).

## `How to install?` [![Abogen Compatible PyPi Python Versions](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c83cc79631886146a58d279a7b42aca1febcc6e93417836ad81ded7547cbf5e/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f707976657273696f6e732f61626f67656e)](https://pypi.org/project/abogen/)

[](#how-to-install-)

### Windows

[](#windows)

Go to [espeak-ng latest release](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/latest) download and run the \*.msi file.

#### OPTION 1: Install using script

[](#option-1-install-using-script)

1.  [Download](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository
2.  Extract the ZIP file
3.  Run `WINDOWS_INSTALL.bat` by double-clicking it

This method handles everything automatically - installing all dependencies including CUDA in a self-contained environment without requiring a separate Python installation. (You still need to install [espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/latest).)

Note

You don't need to install Python separately. The script will install Python automatically.

#### OPTION 2: Install using pip

[](#option-2-install-using-pip)

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
mkdir abogen && cd abogen
python -m venv venv
venv\\Scripts\\activate

# For NVIDIA GPUs:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# For AMD GPUs:
# Not supported yet, because ROCm is not available on Windows. Use Linux if you have AMD GPU.

# Install abogen
pip install abogen

### Mac

[](#mac)

# Install espeak-ng
brew install espeak-ng

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
mkdir abogen && cd abogen
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install abogen
pip3 install abogen

### Linux

[](#linux)

# Install espeak-ng
sudo apt install espeak-ng # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo pacman -S espeak-ng # Arch Linux
sudo dnf install espeak-ng # Fedora

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
mkdir abogen && cd abogen
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install abogen
pip3 install abogen

# For NVIDIA GPUs:
# Already supported, no need to install CUDA separately.

# For AMD GPUs:
# After installing abogen, we need to uninstall the existing torch package
pip3 uninstall torch 
pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4

Tip

If you get `WARNING: The script abogen-cli is installed in '/home/username/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.` error, run the following command to add it to your PATH:

echo "export PATH=\\"/home/$USER/.local/bin:\\$PATH\\"" \>> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

Tip

If you get "No matching distribution found" error, try installing it on supported Python (3.10 to 3.12). You can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage multiple Python versions easily in Linux. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVyb-nI4KyI) by NetworkChuck for a quick guide.

> Special thanks to [@hg000125](https://github.com/hg000125) for his contribution in [#23](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/issues/23). AMD GPU support is possible thanks to his work.

## `How to run?`

[](#how-to-run)

If you installed using pip, you can simply run the following command to start Abogen:

abogen

Tip

If you installed using the Windows installer `(WINDOWS_INSTALL.bat)`, It should have created a shortcut in the same folder, or your desktop. You can run it from there. If you lost the shortcut, Abogen is located in `python_embedded/Scripts/abogen.exe`. You can run it from there directly.

## `How to use?`

[](#how-to-use)

1.  Drag and drop any ePub, PDF, or text file (or use the built-in text editor)
2.  Configure the settings:
    *   Set speech speed
    *   Select a voice (or create a custom voice using voice mixer)
    *   Select subtitle generation style (by sentence, word, etc.)
    *   Select output format
    *   Select where to save the output
3.  Hit Start

## `In action`

[](#in-action)

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/abogen.gif "Abogen in action")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/abogen.gif)

Hereâs Abogen in action: in this demo, it processes â¼3,000 characters of text in just 11 seconds and turns it into 3 minutes and 28 seconds of audio, and I have a low-end **RTXÂ 2060Â Mobile laptop GPU**. Your results may vary depending on your hardware.

## `Configuration`

[](#configuration)

Options

Description

**Input Box**

Drag and drop `ePub`, `PDF`, or `.TXT` files (or use built-in text editor)

**Queue options**

Add multiple files to a queue and process them in batch, with individual settings for each file. See [Queue mode](#queue-mode) for more details.

**Speed**

Adjust speech rate from `0.1x` to `2.0x`

**Select Voice**

First letter of the language code (e.g., `a` for American English, `b` for British English, etc.), second letter is for `m` for male and `f` for female.

**Voice mixer**

Create custom voices by mixing different voice models with a profile system. See [Voice Mixer](#voice-mixer) for more details.

**Voice preview**

Listen to the selected voice before processing.

**Generate subtitles**

`Disabled`, `Sentence`, `Sentence + Comma`, `1 word`, `2 words`, `3 words`, etc. (Represents the number of words in each subtitle entry)

**Output voice format**

`.WAV`, `.FLAC`, `.MP3`, `.OPUS (best compression)` and `M4B (with chapters)` (Special thanks to [@jborza](https://github.com/jborza) for chapter support in PR [#10](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/pull/10))

**Output subtitle format**

Configures the subtitle format as `SRT (standard)`, `ASS (wide)`, `ASS (narrow)`, `ASS (centered wide)`, or `ASS (centered narrow)`.

**Replace single newlines with spaces**

Replaces single newlines with spaces in the text. This is useful for texts that have imaginary line breaks.

## `Voice Mixer`

[](#voice-mixer)

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/voice_mixer.png "Abogen Voice Mixer")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/voice_mixer.png)

With voice mixer, you can create custom voices by mixing different voice models. You can adjust the weight of each voice and save your custom voice as a profile for future use. The voice mixer allows you to create unique and personalized voices. (Huge thanks to [@jborza](https://github.com/jborza) for making this possible through his contributions in [#5](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/pull/5))

## `Queue Mode`

[](#queue-mode)

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/queue.png "Abogen queue mode")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/queue.png)

Abogen supports **queue mode**, allowing you to add multiple files to a processing queue. This is useful if you want to convert several files in one batch.

*   You can add text files (`.txt`) directly using the **Add files** button in the Queue Manager. To add PDF or EPUB files, use the input box in the main window and click the **Add to Queue** button.
*   Each file in the queue keeps the configuration settings that were active when it was added. Changing the main window configuration afterward does **not** affect files already in the queue.
*   You can view each file's configuration by hovering over them.

Abogen will process each item in the queue automatically, saving outputs as configured.

> Special thanks to [@jborza](https://github.com/jborza) for adding queue mode in PR [#35](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/pull/35)

## `About Chapter Markers`

[](#about-chapter-markers)

When you process ePUB or PDF files, Abogen converts them into text files stored in your cache directory. When you click "Edit," you're actually modifying these converted text files. In these text files, you'll notice tags that look like this:

```
<<CHAPTER_MARKER:Chapter Title>>
```

These are chapter markers. They are automatically added when you process ePUB or PDF files, based on the chapters you select. They serve an important purpose:

*   Allow you to split the text into separate audio files for each chapter
*   Save time by letting you reprocess only specific chapters if errors occur, rather than the entire file

You can manually add these markers to plain text files for the same benefits. Simply include them in your text like this:

```
<<CHAPTER_MARKER:Introduction>>
This is the beginning of my text...  

<<CHAPTER_MARKER:Main Content>> 
Here's another part...  
```

When you process the text file, Abogen will detect these markers automatically and ask if you want to save each chapter separately and create a merged version.

## `About Metadata Tags`

[](#about-metadata-tags)

Similar to chapter markers, it is possible to add metadata tags for `M4B` files. This is useful for audiobook players that support metadata, allowing you to add information like title, author, year, etc. Abogen automatically adds these tags when you process ePUB or PDF files, but you can also add them manually to your text files. Add metadata tags **at the beginning of your text file** like this:

```
<<METADATA_TITLE:Title>>
<<METADATA_ARTIST:Author>>
<<METADATA_ALBUM:Album Title>>
<<METADATA_YEAR:Year>>
<<METADATA_ALBUM_ARTIST:Album Artist>>
<<METADATA_COMPOSER:Narrator>>
<<METADATA_GENRE:Audiobook>>
```

## `Supported Languages`

[](#supported-languages)

```
# ðºð¸ 'a' => American English, ð¬ð§ 'b' => British English
# ðªð¸ 'e' => Spanish es
# ð«ð· 'f' => French fr-fr
# ð®ð³ 'h' => Hindi hi
# ð®ð¹ 'i' => Italian it
# ð¯ðµ 'j' => Japanese: pip install misaki[ja]
# ð§ð· 'p' => Brazilian Portuguese pt-br
# ð¨ð³ 'z' => Mandarin Chinese: pip install misaki[zh]
```

For a complete list of supported languages and voices, refer to Kokoro's [VOICES.md](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/blob/main/VOICES.md). To listen to sample audio outputs, see [SAMPLES.md](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/blob/main/SAMPLES.md).

## `MPV Config`

[](#mpv-config)

I highly recommend using [MPV](https://mpv.io/installation/) to play your audio files, as it supports displaying subtitles even without a video track. Here's my `mpv.conf`:

```
# --- MPV Settings ---
save-position-on-quit
keep-open=yes
# --- Subtitle ---
sub-ass-override=no
sub-margin-y=50
sub-margin-x=50
# --- Audio Quality ---
audio-spdif=ac3,dts,eac3,truehd,dts-hd
audio-channels=auto
audio-samplerate=48000
volume-max=200
```

## `Docker Guide`

[](#docker-guide)

If you want to run Abogen in a Docker container:

1.  [Download the repository](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract, or clone it using git.
2.  Go to `abogen` folder. You should see `Dockerfile` there.
3.  Open your termminal in that directory and run the following commands:

# Build the Docker image:
docker build --progress plain -t abogen .

# Note that building the image may take a while.
# After building is complete, run the Docker container:

# Windows
docker run --name abogen -v %cd%:/shared -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 --gpus all abogen

# Linux
docker run --name abogen -v $(pwd):/shared -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 --gpus all abogen

# MacOS
docker run --name abogen -v $(pwd):/shared -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 abogen

# We expose port 5800 for use by a web browser, 5900 if you want to connect with a VNC client.

Abogen launches automatically inside the container.

*   You can access it via a web browser at [http://localhost:5800](http://localhost:5800) or connect to it using a VNC client at `localhost:5900`.
*   You can use `/shared` directory to share files between your host and the container.
*   For later use, start it with `docker start abogen` and stop it with `docker stop abogen`.

Known issues:

*   Audio preview is not working inside container (ALSA error).
*   `Open cache directory` and `Open configuration directory` options in settings not working. (Tried pcmanfm, did not work with Abogen).

(Special thanks to [@geo38](https://www.reddit.com/user/geo38/) from Reddit, who provided the Dockerfile and instructions in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1k8x1yo/comment/mpe0bz8/).)
