Roughly a year ago at the first ever [Local First Conference](https://www.localfirstconf.com/), a friend and previous colleague – [Alex Good](https://patternist.xyz) – told me about this tool called `jj` ([Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/)). We did the usual thing and I sat down beside him as he explained it to me. My brain did the usual thing and took in some of the information but not enough of it, and so I didn’t touch `jj` for quite some time after that – but what’s good enough for Alex Good is good enough for me.

After that, I feel like I saw a post about `jj` once every couple of months on Hacker News – confirmation bias anyone? It was a constant talking point during Git Merge 2024, and now it’s a third Git tool that uses the concept of change identifiers, so it’s a talking point on the [Git mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAESOdVAspxUJKGAA58i0tvks4ZOfoGf1Aa5gPr0FXzdcywqUUw@mail.gmail.com/).

So, fast-forward a year or so, and I’ve been using `jj` for quite some time while contributing to and maintaining the `heartwood` repository – the home of the Radicle protocol – as well as some others. Did I have to convince my whole team that `jj` should be used by all of us and we all switch to this new workflow? No. The first piece of “magic” of `jj` is that it is essentially a version control system that has a transparent layer on top of Git itself. A change in `jj` will always point to a Git commit. The beauty of its implementation is that the underlying commit can change as much as it wants, while the `jj` change remains the same. This unlocks a lot of nice flows for managing changes using `jj`.

So, you must be wondering by now, “How do I blend Radicle with `jj`?” Well, let’s dance between the three worlds of `jj`, Git, and Radicle, to see how they have melted together to form a beautiful (_almost_) branch-less workflow.

### Radicle and Git

I won’t spend too much time here, but if you don’t know by now, Radicle works on top of Git to allow people to use this ubiquitous tool, while we benefit from its storage and protocol. When you start a Radicle repository, it’s essentially a Git repository where we use some special references and extension points of Git to cryptographically secure your commits, and store all your [social, collaborative artifacts](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#2-collaborating-the-radicle-way). If you haven’t yet, go [download](https://radicle.xyz/download) Radicle and try it yourself using our [guides](https://radicle.xyz/guides).

Note that if you’re already familiar with `jj` this might not be that interesting for you, and you can skip to [User Config](#user-config).

#### My `.git/config`

As a maintainer of a few repositories using Radicle, I naturally need to push to and fetch from the repository in Radicle [storage](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z3trNYnLWS11cJWC6BbxDs5niGo82/tree/0003-storage-layout.md). This means that I’ll need a remote – this is set up for you when you run `rad init` or `rad clone`. This looks like:

```
[remote "rad"]
	url = rad://z371PVmDHdjJucejRoRYJcDEvD5pp
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/rad/*
	fetch = +refs/tags/*:refs/remotes/rad/tags/*
	pushurl = rad://z371PVmDHdjJucejRoRYJcDEvD5pp/z6MkireRatUThvd3qzfKht1S44wpm4FEWSSa4PRMTSQZ3voM
[branch "master"]
	remote = rad
	merge = refs/heads/master
```

The `rad://` URL tells `git` which [remote helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitremote-helpers) to use by trying to find `git-remote-rad`. This will handle fetching/pushing from/to the repository identified by `z371PVmDHdjJucejRoRYJcDEvD5pp`. The string `z6MkireRatUThvd3qzfKht1S44wpm4FEWSSa4PRMTSQZ3voM` is my Node ID, and identifies my machine which makes sure that when I push, my references get stored under that [namespace](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z3trNYnLWS11cJWC6BbxDs5niGo82/tree/0003-storage-layout.md#layout). Then when have the usual upstream branch setup for `master` for the `rad` remote – you may be familiar with this Git config entry when you have your `origin` set up for another Git forge.

There’s one last piece of the puzzle in config that is an alias for easily creating a Radicle [patch](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#working-with-patches).

```
[alias]
    patch = push rad HEAD:refs/patches
```

When you push to the special reference `refs/patches`, the remote helper will catch this and create a new patch for you, and in this case it will use whatever `HEAD` is for the head of the patch. Note that it will use whatever `rad/master` is as the base of the patch – that is to say, whatever commits are between `rad/master` and `HEAD` (including `HEAD`) are the commits being proposed by the patch. So, whenever I’m ready to make a patch, I use `git patch` and my `$EDITOR` pops open to make my well-crafted message describing what changes I’m making.

#### `git fetch rad` and `git push rad`

This is going to be brief. All I do with `git` now is `git fetch rad` (or my peer’s remotes) to fetch any new work in Radicle storage. For pushing I will use `git push rad` to create or update patches (coming up), update my version of `master`, and, on the rare occasion, push a branch. That’s it! No more `commit`, no more `rebase`, no more `merge` – ok I still use `git log` – but that’s pretty much it. So how did I ditch all of these commands? Let’s take a look `jj`.

### Jujutsu and Git

Let’s see how I’m using `jj` by visiting several of its commands and seeing how I can use them in different scenarios.

#### `jj new`

It’s only natural to start off with `jj new`. This command creates a new change in `jj`, as well as creating a new, empty commit for that change. Whenever I’m going to make a new change that’s based on the `master` branch, I run:

$ jj new master@rad
Working copy  (@) now at: qxuvyurn 8e711a87 (empty) (no description set)
Parent commit (@-)      : xslqmmsl 62cdaf6d master@rad | deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers
Added 0 files, modified 0 files, removed 1 files

You’ll notice that `jj` spits out a Change ID and a Commit ID. You may also notice that a prefix is highlighted – this is the unique prefix for the change and the commit at this time! Which means that I can use `qx` or `8e` to refer to this particular change or commit without any ambiguity; an amazing UX, if you ask me.

At this point, I might know what I’m going to be working on so I use `jj describe` to give this change a message.

$ jj describe -m "blog: Radicle and JJ"
Working copy  (@) now at: qxuvyurn 408133a5 (empty) blog: Radicle and JJ
Parent commit (@-)      : xslqmmsl 62cdaf6d master@rad | deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers

I’ve now changed the description so that it no longer says `(no description yet)`, and it now reads `blog: Radicle and JJ`.

So let’s see what we have here:

$ jj show qx
Commit ID: 408133a5e54c80d2398be0c78cccabbd6063902d
Change ID: qxuvyurnqsvupzlpzsvzzpqlmlqvoxwq
Author   : Fintan Halpenny <fintan.halpenny@radicle.xyz\> (2025-06-10 07:52:34)
Committer: Fintan Halpenny <fintan.halpenny@radicle.xyz\> (2025-06-10 07:52:34)

    blog: Radicle and JJ

We can see that it looks similar to a Git commit, which we can also inspect using:

$ git show 408133a5e54c80d2398be0c78cccabbd6063902d
commit 408133a5e54c80d2398be0c78cccabbd6063902d
Author: Fintan Halpenny <fintan.halpenny@radicle.xyz>
Date:   2025-06-10 07:52:34 +0200

    blog: Radicle and JJ

This leaves us in a position to do our usual changes within our working copy of the Git repository.

At any point where I’m looking to separate changes, I can use `jj new` again, specifying any change to make a new change after the given change:

$ jj new qx
Working copy  (@) now at: wmsmovxx c50301c1 (empty) (no description set)
Parent commit (@-)      : qxuvyurn 408133a5 blog: Radicle and JJ

$ jj describe -m "blog: Radicle an JJ - add body"
Working copy  (@) now at: wmsmovxx a3d195ad (empty) blog: Radicle and JJ – add body
Parent commit (@-)      : qxuvyurn 408133a5 blog: Radicle and JJ

If I ever think I’m about to make some changes before the change I’m on, then I can use the `-B` option:

$ jj new -B @
Rebased 1 descendant commits
Working copy  (@) now at: zvrmpyox f0635336 (empty) (no description set)
Parent commit (@-)      : xslqmmsl 62cdaf6d master@rad | deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers
Added 0 files, modified 0 files, removed 1 files

#### `jj edit`

At any point in time, I can also decide to go back to an old change and edit it, specifying the change that I want to edit:

$ jj edit qx
Working copy  (@) now at: qxuvyurn 408133a5 blog: Radicle and JJ
Parent commit (@-)      : xslqmmsl 62cdaf6d master@rad | deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers

You can now forget about all those `fixup!` commits you were making to add changes into previous commits. No longer are you at the mercy of making a commit that is ahead of some other changes and you need to reorder it using `git rebase`. You taste that? It tastes like victory…

#### `jj squash`

Ok, so you’ve made some changes that are not related to the current change? This happens, or at least it does to me – I’m not perfect, (un)fortunately. I can use the power of `jj new`, whether after or before the current change, and combine it with `jj squash`:

$ jj squash -u --from w --to qx
Rebased 1 descendant commits
Working copy  (@) now at: qxuvyurn 1e2b0ccc (empty) blog: Radicle and JJ
Parent commit (@-)      : xslqmmsl 62cdaf6d master@rad | deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers

This says that I’m squashing the changes from the change identified by `r` into the change `xn`, and I want to keep the description of `xn` and drop the description of `r` (the `-u` option).

For extra points, `jj` even includes the beautiful `-i` option for _choosing_ which changes you’re taking from the source change – via a TUI. I cannot begin to describe how useful this is for moving around file changes and keeping my history clean and linear.

#### `jj rebase`

The final piece of the puzzle, at least for my workflow, is `jj rebase`. I can move around changes and put them on top of a destination change:

$ jj rebase -d qx -r sm
Working copy  (@) now at: smvvuqzo 420180e8 blog: relevant blog material
Parent commit (@-)      : qxuvyurn 1e2b0ccc blog: Radicle and JJ
Added 1 files, modified 0 files, removed 0 files

This rebases the change `sm` onto the change `qx`. In fact, the `-r` can take a set of changes (see [revsets](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/revsets)) and graft them all on top of the destination.

#### My `.jj/config`

The final part I’ll touch on is my `jj` config, which can be split into the user and repo config. Thanks to Bruno, who wrote a lot of this on Zulip, and I cribbed it from him.

##### User Config

Here is my user config, and we’ll discuss a couple of the entries, and I’ll leave the rest as homework.

```
[aliases]
dlog = ["log", "-r"]
l = ["log", "-r", "(trunk()..@):: | (trunk()..@)-"]
fresh = ["new", "trunk()"]
tug = [
    "bookmark",
    "move",
    "--from",
    "closest_bookmark(@)",
    "--to",
    "closest_pushable(@)",
]

[revset-aliases]
"closest_bookmark(to)" = "heads(::to & bookmarks())"
"closest_pushable(to)" = "heads(::to & mutable() & ~description(exact:\"\") & (~empty() | merges()))"
"desc(x)" = "description(x)"
"pending()" = ".. ~ ::tags() ~ ::remote_bookmarks() ~ @ ~ private()"
"private()" = "description(glob:'wip:*') | \
    description(glob:'private:*') | \
    description(glob:'WIP:*') | \
    description(glob:'PRIVATE:*') | \
    conflicts() | \
    (empty() ~ merges()) | \
    description('substring-i:\"DO NOT MAIL\"')"
```

*   `fresh`: this allows me to have an alias for `jj new master@rad` and use `jj fresh`.
*   `tug`: this allows me to tug the closest [bookmark](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/bookmarks) to a change that can be pushed – we’ll see an example of this later.

##### Repository Config

And here is my repository config, which we’ll discuss a bit more in detail.

```
[revset-aliases]
"trunk()" = "master@rad"
"immutable_heads()" = "present(trunk()) | \
    tags() | \
    ( \
        untracked_remote_bookmarks() ~ \
        untracked_remote_bookmarks(remote='rad') ~ \
        untracked_remote_bookmarks(regex:'^patch(es)/',remote='rad') \
    )"

[git]
write-change-id-header = true
```

We want to change the `trunk()` alias from its default in `jj` so that it points to `master@rad`, the default branch in this particular Radicle repository. The `trunk()` revset is used in a few place, for example, we saw it above in `fresh`, but it is also in the next revset alias.

Some changes in `jj` will be marked as [immutable](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/config/#set-of-immutable-commits). `jj` will prevent you from changing certain changes if they are marked as immutable, and its default value for this can be very restrictive, so instead we change it here. First we mark changes that are `present` in `trunk()` or `tags()` as immutable. Then we have untracked remote bookmarks with the set difference operator `~`. What are not marking as immutable are bookmarks that are in `rad` or that `patch`/`patches`. That is, if the changes are ours or from patches, then they’re safe to edit. You might think, “Why are patches safe?”” Well, let’s finally get into Radicle and Jujutsu.

### Radicle and Jujutsu

So here we are, a lot of build up to get to the point where I can describe how I can avoid using branches (as much as possible).

#### Contributing Patches

We will first dive into contributing a new patch using Radicle. As described in [Jujutsu and Git](#jujutsu-and-git), I can start making a set of changes using `jj new`, editing them just how I like using `jj edit`, and ordering them just the way I want with `jj rebase` and `jj squash`. During this whole time, I’m in that, initially scary, [detached HEAD state](https://wizardzines.com/comics/detached-head-state/). Here it comes, we’re going to make a patch!

##### Creating a New Patch

```
git patch
```

That’s it. Well, the `$EDITOR` opens and I write a title and a body describing my wonderful changes, and when I’m done, the remote helper will create the patch and announce it to the network.

✓ Patch e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617 opened
✓ Synced with 8 node(s)

To rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
 \* \[new reference\]   HEAD -> refs/patches

##### Updating a Patch

Let’s be honest though, my wonderful changes are rarely wonderful from the get-go. They need some polishing, and my peers always have great suggestions that I should integrate into the patch.

From here, I can find the patch using `rad patch`:

You can see here how non-perfect my changes are, I’m being vulnerable here.

I can now grab the value `Head` in the above table, and use it in `jj`, by running `jj new 34014a67b0ddc859d95e17ffc71c1ae61aff5758`. This will drop me onto a new change after `34014a67b0ddc859d95e17ffc71c1ae61aff5758`, and then I can use `jj log -r ::@` to see all the previous changes.

Again, I use the wonderful `jj edit` command, or perhaps I make new changes that I then `jj squash` into the relevant changes – it all depends on the scope of the change!

Once I’m done, I push `HEAD` to another special [refspec](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-The-Refspec), using the patch’s full identifier:

```
git push rad HEAD:patches/c54883e5ffb1f8a99f432e3ac79c0b728cd0dab3 -f
```

We use `-f` if we are editing the changes since this will change the underlying commits and `git` will reject this. Once again, this will open my `$EDITOR` and I will add a message about the changes that were made in this update.

This creates a new “revision” for the patch, preserving the older revisions. So essentially, patches in Radicle are append-only. This makes it safe for us to make edits to changes, marking them as mutable – the Git history will be preserved!

#### Maintaining Patches

From the maintaining perspective, the flow starts off similar to updating, where I would look up the patch that I want to merge. If I made the patch, things are a bit easier because the Git objects are easily accessible and I can do `jj new` using the commit. If I attempt to do this with a patch that came from another contributor, then I may run into this issue:

$ jj new 7322e3ac61669ba6dbde16bb0f7d30edf1ee85ce
Error: Revision \`7322e3ac61669ba6dbde16bb0f7d30edf1ee85ce\` doesn't exist

The way to do this instead, is to use the remote syntax and the special `patches` reference:

$ jj new patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b@rad
Working copy  (@) now at: ooxzsqoy eb9e0803 (empty) (no description set)
Parent commit (@-)      : swpyssrk 7322e3ac patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b@rad | node, cli: remove predefined bootstrap nodes

At this point, I can also look at what commits are in the patch via `rad patch show`, or by using `jj log -r ::@`. If they’re already on top `master@rad`, then to merge the patch I can simply `git push rad master` – and the remote helper marks the patch as merged if the canonical reference of `master` is update (a topic for another time).

If the patch isn’t on top of `master@rad` then I can rebase the changes using `jj rebase -d master@rad -r <base>::<head>` to get the series of changes on top of our latest. It’s then necessary to push a new revision to the patch so that the patch can know it is being merged with the new commits – remember that I rebased, so this changes the underlying commits.

We should update our `master` bookmark, and this is where the `tug` alias comes in. When I run `jj tug`, it figures out that `master` is the closest bookmark and pulls it up to the latest change that can be pushed. I can then push to update the patch:

```
git push rad master:patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b -f
```

Here I’m using `master` instead of `HEAD` – this gets around a little issue I’ve been seeing for patches that I do not own, where the remote helper rejects the push because it cannot resolve `HEAD` (a mystery left for another day).

Once the patch has been rebased, I can do the usual `git push rad master` to update the canonical reference and have the patch marked as merged.

## Conclusion

And our adventure ends here. We dived into how Radicle works with Git, how Jujutsu works Git, and how I use Jujutsu to have a branch-less flow in Radicle. This is has been a dream to work with. This type of tooling feels like it enables me a lot more when managing my changes and keeping a clean history. I was _able_ to do this with `git rebase`, but it felt like it got in the way more than it enabled me – and I haven’t even touched on how [conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/conflicts) are easy in Jujutsu!

There is plenty of room for improvements here, some things on my list are:

*   Keeping track of Jujutsu change IDs in Radicle data, which is already being looked at!
*   Not needing to use `rad patch show` to get metadata for managing patches, and perhaps even bookmarking patch identifiers automatically.
