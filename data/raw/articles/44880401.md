The Ashet Home Computer is an expandable and hackable computer in the spirit of the 80's home computers. Fully understandable by a single person, yet powerful enough to run a graphical desktop OS, it tries to bridge the gap between Arduinos and a RaspberryPi. It is designed and engineered for fun and learning, which go best hand in hand.

## Project Status & Roadmap

### ![](/img/check.svg) Design

The Ashet Home Computer has completed its design phase, and a practical, achievable hardware concept is now finalized.

There are still many smaller design components to be refined, but the overall concept is done.

_Check out the [hardware design](/hardware/) to learn more about the system._

### ![](/img/check.svg) Prototyping

A functional _cable clutter prototype_ has been created which validates all of the design ideas.

This includes:

*   PSRAM Support
*   DVI Video Generation
*   Backplane Communication
*   Expansion Card Drivers
*   Ethernet
*   I²C Subsystem

Currently, the RP2350 processor successfully boots the operating system and supports launching desktop applications.

The mechanical design is also validated by building a mock-up of the final hardware and case assembly.

_Check out the prototype images and videos in the [gallery](/gallery/#home-computer-photo)!_

### ![](/img/wrench-clock.svg) Engineering

The next stage after prototyping will be the actual engineering. This includes creating schematics, pcb layouts, evaluation of hardware limits and EMI emissions.

In this phase, the fully production-ready computer will be built.

To fund development for this critical next stage, we will launch a crowdfunding campaign on a platform such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter.

### ![](/img/wrench-clock.svg) Production & Release

In parallel to the engineering, a manufacturing partner must be found that will produce and distribute the Ashet Home Computer.

One of the goals is to make the computer available for 250€ or less, but if that’s possible depends on so many details that it’s hard to tell in the current phase.

No matter what’s the outcome of this phase, the whole computer design will be available for free under a _permissive licence_ and can be built by everyone.
