Reddit.com; The OSA has made it impossible to do my subreddit moderation work: I need to be able to review a user's profile if they submit a post/comments to any of the subreddits I moderate. Any profile marked as "18+", which DOES NOT imply pornographic content, is now blocked from view when accessing Reddit from the UK. I refuse outright to scan my face into a dodgy third-party site, so I HAVE to use a VPN to continue moderating my (medical professional) subreddits. It's insane.
