The top secret code behind _Kryptos_, the infamously enigmatic sculpture with four hidden messages that stands at the CIA headquarters, is hitting the auction block in November. Artist Jim Sanborn’s original handwritten code, as well as a “proof-of-concept” prototype for the artwork and other items, are expected to fetch between $300,000 and $500,000, according to RR Auctions.

The artwork has gained a cult following as one section of its encrypted text has remained unsolved since the sculpture debuted in 1990, despite the best efforts of hundreds of fanatical codebreakers. The solution, meanwhile, has been kept under lock and key by Sanborn, who turns 80 this year. He has spent over three decades fielding daily emails from hopefuls desperate for a clue. At last, he is ready to give it all up.

“The ideal outcome would be for the winner to become a guardian of the secret, not its revealer,” said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction. “Imagine the satisfaction of watching someone else crack it through pure intellectual effort, knowing you hold the key to confirm their success. That’s the true legacy of _Kryptos_.”

#### **What Is the Kryptos Sculpture?**

_Kryptos_ was installed on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia on November 3, 1990. It stands 12 feet tall and 20 feet long, curves in an S-shape, and is made of copper, petrified wood, water, and stones. It takes its name from the Greek word for “hidden.”

Into _Kryptos_‘s curved copper screen, Sanborn hand-cut almost 2,000 letters that can be divided into four messages, each using a new code. These cryptographic systems were not designed by the sculptor himself but by Edward Scheidt, who retired as chairman of the CIA’s Cryptographic Center in 1989. Three have already been solved by CIA employees but the fourth, known as K4, remains frustratingly elusive.

“Every artwork strives to hold your attention for as long as possible,” Sanborn told the YouTube channel Great Big Story. “If it’s an artwork that contains something that keeps your attention for even 10 minutes, much less 30 years, I get a great sense of satisfaction from that. It’s become part of many people’s lives.”

Public artworks by Sanborn made in a similar style include _Ex Nexum_ (1994–97) in Little Rock, Arkansas, and _Lux_ (2001) in Fort Myers, Florida. His work has also been exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.

#### **Attempts to Crack the Code**

The mystery of K4 has gained international attention and inspired an army of dedicated sleuths. In the U.S., a group of experts and amateurs alike meets every year to discuss their theories.

The previously interpreted messages include K3, a paraphrasing of Howard Carter’s account of opening Tutankhamun’s tomb, and K1, which reads “between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the nuance of iqlusion.” The text contained an intentional misspelling of “illusion” as a red herring. These messages may aid in cracking K4, as Sanborn has teased that there is a link between all four messages.

Even seasoned cryptographers and intelligence experts have remained baffled by the cryptic text. So far, however, only minimal progress has been made. The few words “northeast” and “Berlin clock” have been revealed thanks to clues offered by Sanborn in 2010, [2014](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/artist-reveals-another-clue-to-24-year-old-mystery-at-cia-178462), and 2020.

Humans hoping they might one day be the one to solve the puzzle will be relieved to know that Sanborn has remained thoroughly unconvinced by A.I.’s efforts so far. He revealed to the [_New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/science/kryptos-sculpture-cia-solution-auction.html) that he has begun receiving solutions devised by ChatGPT, but described these efforts as “nothing short of fairly silly.”

#### **The New Keeper of the Code**

The transfer of ownership of the K4 code from Sanborn to the highest bidder will mark the first time that this top secret information has been shared. He hopes that its new owner will continue to protect the secret, which he said gives the work its power, and that they may even resume the responsibility of reviewing proposed solutions.

Sanborn himself has publicly stated that he is “tired” of dealing with these queries himself, and has begun charging a $50 fee for replies. He told the _NYT_ that this earns him an estimate $40,000 each year. However, he is looking forward to being free from the responsibility of controlling the secrets of K4, allowing him time for new artistic ventures.

So what exactly will _Kryptos_‘s new owner receive? The lot is a veritable goodie bag for any _Kryptos_ enthusiast. As well as the original handwritten K4 code, offered with a signed typed letter from cryptographer Ed Scheidt, they can expect to win the 12-by-18 inch copper maquette submitted as a sample to the CIA in 1988, archival photographs relating to the works’ creation, the original dedication pamphlet signed by the late CIA director William Webster, and copies of coding charts used to code _Kryptos_.

The online auction of _Kryptos_ by RR Auction begins on October 17 and closes on November 20 at 7 p.m. ET. A portion of the proceeds will go to programs for the disabled.
