In [#2795](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2795) there are some discuss about the BLOBs in Ventoy.

For a long time, I devoted my limited spare time to adding new features and fixing bugs and didn't get around to considering this.

**It should be noted firstly that Ventoy is 100% open souce and everything is transparent.**

 Some binary files are directly get from other open source projects and Ventoy directly use them and don't need any change by default.

Now that someone cares about these BLOBs, so I think we can discuss about this and find a better way and use it step by step in Ventoy.

 This will definitely take a long time and need some help but I think it's good for Ventoy.

One approach I'm thinking of right now is that, for these BLOBs, I create some sub-repos in github and build them by github CI just once, and use the binary file in Ventoy.

 If we find some problem in these tools, we can update the source code and build again and use the new binary files in new Ventoy version.

What do you think about this?

For this, I want to confirm that

1.   Can github provide build environment for FreeBSD and Windows ?
2.   Can github provide build environment for Linux with glibc/musl ?

**Update: 2025/05/14**

 Anyway, I think first step we need to get a full BLOBs list in current Ventoy source code.

 Refer to [#2795 (comment)](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2795#issuecomment-2233938098) I create a list here.

 And also I create a file in the source tree [https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/blob/master/BLOB_List.md](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/blob/master/BLOB_List.md) to maintain the list.

 If you find some BLOBs which are not included in the list or some mistake, please let me known, thanks!

Thanks for adressing this :)

In my opinion if removing the BLOBs would significantly hinder your general progress on the project then please keep it as a "side project" to slowly remove them, but not as a main focus. Maybe mention them in the main readme and link to the sources you used so others can check them out.

Much of the legitimate concern in [#2795](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2795) stems from needing to trust Ventoy.

While Ventoy is open source, as [@fnr1r](https://github.com/fnr1r) has been discovering in [https://github.com/fnr1r/ventoy-cpio](https://github.com/fnr1r/ventoy-cpio), the build process is very complicated. Documenting sources of binary files, scripts used in the build process and within the runtime environment would go a long way. The easier it is audit what it takes to build Ventoy, the easier it is to trust Ventoy.

While all binaries and blobs may not be able to be built from source, those that remain should be clearly stated with a reason why they cannot be built from source. For example, if it is proprietary and the source is not available, assuming there is a matching checksum to the original input, it then that puts the need for trust on this third party.

It is also a very difficult goal, but I would strong suggest striving to make Ventoy a reproducible build. In the simplest terms, anyone can build from the source and create the same bit for bit binary every time. [Reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) are the gold standard for trusting a built shared binary.

In the simplest terms, anyone can build from the source and create the same bit for bit binary every time. [Reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) are the gold standard for trusting a built shared binary.

reproducible build is perfect in theory, but it is very difficult in practice.

 For example, if the C code use `__DATE__` macro, then the build output will be different each time.

 Ventoy use many open source projects, so it can not change all the code to match the requirement of reproducible build.

All the binary files in Ventoy have the corresponding source code.

 In the document [https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/blob/master/DOC/BuildVentoyFromSource.txt](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/blob/master/DOC/BuildVentoyFromSource.txt) I have list all the binary files, where it get from or how to build it as follows:

For example, Ventoy directly use some busybox binary files downloaded from busybox official website.

 BusyBox is a very famous and widely used open-source project.

 So I think it's OK to directly use their pre-built binaries, if we find that the version Ventoy use has some security problem, this should have been fixed in new BusyBox version, so Ventoy can just use their new fixed version and no need to build it from source.

> Can github provide build environment for FreeBSD and Windows?

FreeBSD support in vmactions has been mentioned already. There's also an open issue for FreeBSD support in GitHub actions: [actions/runner#385](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/385)

It would also be possible to add a FreeBSD port for the Ventoy kernel module, which would automatically make it available for all supported FreeBSD versions on an ongoing basis (currently 13.5, 14.2, 15.0). Ventoy could then obtain it from there.

Longer term I have some work in progress for the FreeBSD boot which would avoid the need for a special kernel module.

> reproducible build is perfect in theory, but it is very difficult in practice.

Many projects have invested a lot of effort into reproducible builds over the last 10+ years and it is not so difficult to achieve now. Packages for the FreeBSD base system are (nearly) all reproducible. I don't have recent stats on our 3rd party software collection, but Debian's 30000+ package collection is over 95% reproducible.

For example, Ventoy use official grub2/busybox/... project source code, I think we should firstly push the upstream project to achieve reproducible build.

 Take busybox as example, Venoty directly use its binary function, and I'm not familar with its code and build progress, so if it does not support reproducible build, it's hard for Ventoy to do this.

Agreed that this relies on the upstream project, it's not something Ventoy should need to do itself. In the case of busybox it is already reproducible in Debian's CI (except for i386): [https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/unstable/amd64/busybox.html](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/unstable/amd64/busybox.html)

You might want to use Nix the package manager. Nixpkgs is currently the biggest Linux package repository. Although versions may differ, you can always lock which revision of nixpkgs goes into building the project for maximum reproducibility (flakes makes this much easier, but it's a great way to burn yourself out if you've never used Nix before).

[You can find what's available on both the stable and unstable branch here.](https://search.nixos.org/packages)

 Don't hesitate to ask for help around Nix if you get around to use it.

There aren't really any disadvantages to curling or wget-ing any publicly available binaries that are already trustworthy.

As [@hustlerone](https://github.com/hustlerone) already said

> There are blobs which are unexcusable. 7-zip is not the problem

so maybe we should stop stressing over a wget and start focusing on the things brought up at the end of [#2795](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2795) (before it was closed for some reason) like:

> > Analyzing "iventoy.dat.xz\iventoy.dat.\win\vtoypxe64.exe" we see it includes a self signed certificate named "EV" certificate "JemmyLoveJenny EV Root CA0" at offset=0x0002C840 length=0x70E.
> >

[#2795 (comment)](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2795#issuecomment-2856491963)

 Which, as far as I know we never got an official response for.

JemmyloveJenny's a Chinese person of street fame. Searching up the full certificate name mentioned you get its origins in [https://github.com/Jemmy1228/HookSigntool](https://github.com/Jemmy1228/HookSigntool), which seems to be a way to make drivers work by giving them signatures. I think it's understandable that Ventoy would need to ship drivers.

Looking at the repo provided, it's clear that this is a relatively unknown tool which may or may not be malicious in it's self (just because the readme says it does x, doesn't mean it actually does) and still is included in binary form in the "source". Also, why the obfuscation? Why is this encoded in a dat with some unknown byte-swapping obfuscation algorithm? This is extremely suspicious, and it is not understandable why this is in the code.

Could you link to the comment that says there's a byte-swapping obfuscation algorithm? It also might be a compilation option recommended by the upstream dependency.

> just because the readme says it does x

It's just 300+ lines of code (including 100+ lines from a header file, which is just a list of function signatures without any implementations) , so we could just have somebody with knowledge of Windows APIs read it.

Ok, some corrections from my earlier post:

This was an issue with iVentoy, a pxe bootloader which is different from ventoy significantly but still casts doubt on the author and therefore ventoy too.

 For the sake of accuracy I'll quote the entire message here:

On the obfuscation: iVentoy is closed source seemingly because Mr. Ventoy wanted to monetize it into a paid edition, which is activated by simply putting a license key file next to the already downloaded iVentoy files. It's plausible that without this, one would use internet tools reverse-engineer iVentoy to remove the license check. It's not like the byte swapping is all that complicated anyways: according to the OP of that thread iVentoy even outputs the deobfuscated data while it is running. Anyone who's not a script kiddie could probably figure out how to deobfuscate, and now that there's a Python script even script kiddies can.

Those are not things that apply to Ventoy. All of the above simply constitute a valid issue of transparency, which Ventoy does not lack. Everything Ventoy does is documented in the code here and nobody has found blob files different from upstream. Giving any app administrator permissions allows it to steal and delete all of your data. The issue mentioned in that thread is that iVentoy does not tell you this is what it does, nevertheless in a closed-source component. Mr. Ventoy used document tools for privilege escalation to install open-source kernel drivers in the temporary environment. I don't see what's the problem with installing open-source kernel drivers in the temporary environment. I do see the problem in users not being informed, but now users have been informed. I don't see the implications that the iVentoy thread has for Ventoy, other than Mr. Ventoy being quite bad at noting down what might raise suspicion and documenting in advance such things that plausibly seem like exploits.

I honestly do not understand this unrelenting advocacy. Do you think it is reasonable for anyone to be even slightly suspicious of any of the projects by this guy?

> It's not like the byte swapping is all that complicated anyways: according to the OP of that thread iVentoy even outputs the deobfuscated data while it is running.

No, it's not complicated, but why is it there in the first place. AV programs and such aren't smart enough to look at static binaries and deobfuscate the file in question. OP even said that the decrypted file had a high AV rating.

> other than Mr. Ventoy being quite bad at noting down what might raise suspicion and documenting in advance such things that plausibly seem like exploits.

It is not a plausibility that HookSignTool is an exploit. IT IS A FACT. As said in the previously quoted post:

> vtoypxe64.exe programmatically installs this certificate in the registry as a "trusted root certificate" [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\ROOT\Certificates\E403A1DFC8F377E0F4AA43A83EE9EA079A1F55F2] exactly as explained by "Jemmy1228" (the author of the fake root certificates) here: [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/84765/how-to-generate-self-signed-ev-ssl-certificate](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/84765/how-to-generate-self-signed-ev-ssl-certificate)

If your program needs to exploit windows vulnerabilities to "work" that should raise red flags and alarm bells not only for the program, but for the authors too.

Valid certs aren't free, **someone** has to pay if it must change.

I didn't say that was unreasonable, I just think it's more reasonable to trust it for now.

I don't see the harm in using an exploit to do something compared to not using an exploit to do the same thing. An argument you didn't mention is that other malware could use use this certificate to install their own kernel drivers and change what websites look like without needing to install its own certificate, but it's must easier for malware to do this exploit itself with administrator permissions instead, especially as these things also need administrator permissions (unless your router is also compromised or the attackers use a website, but websites can be verified by other certificate authorities IIRC). That argument also ignores that the certificate is not trusted in the user's actual system, but just the PXE environment instead.

> why is it there in the first place

I just said probably as a rudimentary way against people bypassing restrictions to use the Pro version, which is included in the Free version download. Read what I said before what you quoted.

> OP even said that the decrypted file had a high AV rating.

That doesn't say too much. I used a Minecraft launcher once that would regularly have its executables flagged by AV, including Windows Defender which would only stop flagging it when the manual review sent to Microsoft by the developer passed after a day. Every single release had to be sent for manual review.

^^ valid points brought up there, but as even [@aaronliu0130](https://github.com/aaronliu0130) brought up this was not noted in the readme (or anywhere) on iVentoy. I still believe that the whole cert deal is still a bit concerning. The reason this was even brought up was because the last 10 messages were about how to install 7-zip in a build script:

> so maybe we should stop stressing over a wget and start focusing on the things brought up at the end of [#2795](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2795) (before it was closed for some reason) like...

and then there ended up being 20 messages about the cert example that I brought up... not productive, sorry

This discussion is starting to get unproductive. In order to solve this issue we should focus on an actual build system, not argue with "erm actually ########".
