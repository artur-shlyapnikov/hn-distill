# Correct The World Map

**For over 450 years, we have based our understanding of Africa, and the world, on a map that is wrong! In fact, you could fit the United States, China, India, Japan, Mexico and much of Europe into Africa and still have land to spare.**

**The Mercator map isn’t just about misrepresenting the size of the global South — it’s about power and perception. This needs to change.**

**We call the world to correct the map by adopting the [Equal Earth projection](https://equal-earth.com/equal-earth-projection.html), which more accurately reflects the true size of Africa.**

#### It is time to correct the Map. [Download the Equal Earth Map here.](https://equal-earth.com/) [Join the movement – Sign the petition today.](https://chng.it/BpfHGnMM9T)

Drag the line to see how the Mercator projection distorts the world—exaggerating the size of some regions compared to Africa.

## It’s time to act!

Challenge the status quo, by dismantling a colonial legacy that has distorted Africa’s identity and reshaped how the world perceives the Global South.

By [signing the petition](https://chng.it/BpfHGnMM9T) you take a stand against a false narrative that downplays Africa’s vast size and diversity as the second-largest continent, reducing its perceived importance in global politics and economics. **You can correct the narrative.**

## Your organisation can lead the change

We invite you and your organisation to be the change you want to see in the world! Sign the campaign [charter](https://correctthemap.org/charter/) today. Show your voluntarily commitment to using the [Equal Earth map projection](https://equal-earth.com/equal-earth-projection.html) in all digital representations and physical publications that include Africa on a world map.
