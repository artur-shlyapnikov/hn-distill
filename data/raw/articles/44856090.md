# After 34 Years AOL Finally Closes its Dial-up Internet Service

![aol uk homepage from the past](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nggallery_import/aol-uk-homepage-from-the-past-e1754805650657-600x600.webp)

In a somewhat surprising development, mainly because almost everybody assumed it had died a long time ago, [AOL](https://www.aol.co.uk/) (America Online) – one of the very first consumer ISPs in both the USA and UK – recently caused a stir again by announcing that it had “_decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet_” on 30th September 2025.

According to [AOL’s website](https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued): “_AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans. As a result, on September 30, 2025 this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which are optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, will be discontinued_.” But their email service will continue.

**NOTE:** Many [dialup](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/dialup "dialup") ISPs in the UK during 1995 – like AOL – used expensive premium rate numbers, although this did soon gravitate to local call rates and then unmetered via FRIACO. The v90 [dialup](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/dialup "dialup") standard (56Kbps capable or 0.056Mbps) didn’t arrive until 1998 and by then [ADSL](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/adsl "digital subscriber line") and cable broadband were just around the corner – ready to revolutionise the market.

The change appears to have been announced within the past few weeks, although it wasn’t picked up more widely until journalist [Ernie Smith](https://tedium.co/) noted it in a post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ernie.tedium.co/post/3lvwjugziec2f). Just to be clear, the announcement above refers to the USA and Canada. However, we’re fairly confident that what remains of AOL UK (aka – [TalkTalk](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/go/tt "talktalk")) doesn’t have any legacy dial-up customers left, although we would have said the same about the USA and Canada too, until that announcement dropped (dial-up speeds in 2025 would be practically unusable). ISPreview is currently checking, just to be sure.

In case anybody has forgotten. The original AOL UK experience was somewhat of a walled-garden way of accessing the internet, which forced you to use the company’s own software and restricted your ability to access certain internet services. This had the benefit of simplifying the experience, but AOL later fell behind the curve and ended up being overtaken by rivals.

The [Carphone Warehouse](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/go/cpw "carphone warehouse") (CPW) ultimately won the auction to buy AOL UK’s Internet access business in 2006 for £370m (note: AOL’s content division became a separate business). At the time, AOL were the UK’s third-largest ISP with around **2.1 million customers** (600,000 on dial-up and 1.5 million with broadband) and were later re-branded to AOL Broadband.

A second big change occurred on 29th March 2010, when CPW and [TalkTalk](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/go/tt "talktalk") separated (demerged) – the latter became a separate business, which included customers from CPW’s prior acquisitions (e.g. AOL Broadband, Tiscali etc.). Several more years passed until May 2014, when TalkTalk confirmed that AOL Broadband (formerly AOL UK) had stopped taking on new internet and phone customers ([here](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2014/05/uk-isp-aol-broadband-longer-available-new-customers.html)), although no mention was made of the dial-up base.

We’re certain that plenty of our readers (those now of a certain age group) will have stories to share of the early AOL UK days. Yours truly only used the original service briefly, before promptly switching away as the UK’s then dialup (narrowband) internet market became more competitive, affordable and less restrictive. It’s a service I was glad to forget, but it played an important role.

    I seem to remember they used to charge £15 a month to allow you to dial up via the freephone 0800 number and Joanna Lumley announcing “Welcome To AOL” & “You Got Mail”. I used to tie up the phone line for hours during peak Napster & the frustration when the call dropped half way through a download. Ultimately I left when I went to BT ADSL in 2002, BT were actually £5 a month cheaper than AOL’s offering.

        AOL were my first ISP and I remember it being maybe a fiver a month plus a local rate call for a few hours of access per month.
        
        I remember Joanna Lumley’s voice too, although I’m pretty sure they had her saying “You’ve got post!” back when I was using it around ’98.
        
        After a few months I moved to Free Dot Net, which was charging £30 (plus local call rate) for two years of access. This was an incredible deal at the time, when all other ISPs still charged a monthly subscription, and before the likes of Freeserve came on the scene.

    Dial up in those day was an expensive way to get Internet access at home. Calls were costed per minute so Internet cafes sprung up everywhere. Some still exist.

    AHH paying £2.95 or whatever it was per hour plus the phone call. I was lucky enough to be on the beta test when they launched the monthly service (think it was about 19.95 but that included an 0800 dialup number and “unlimited use”.

        It won’t work once the PSTN shuts. Modems can’t maintain a carrier detect over a VoIP connection.

    I was with them back in the day, I still remember the first time streaming video via ADSL.
    
    We ultimately left though for “Be” because they introduced data caps and IIRC Be was also cheaper for that first year, been going between ISPs ever since.
