is a senior editor and author of [_Notepad_](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter), who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.

GitHub has accidentally announced OpenAI’s new range of GPT-5 models. A now-deleted GitHub blog post reveals that GPT-5, which will be available in four different versions, offers “major improvements in reasoning, code quality, and user experience.”

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mjpwyx/gpt5_is_now_generally_available_in_github_models/?share_id=Kl1fpsp17VSPcA93L9qpA&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) posters noticed a new GitHub blog post announcing that GPT-5 is generally available in GitHub models, before the blog post was quickly removed. An [archived version](https://archive.ph/2025.08.07-040507/https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-06-gpt-5-is-now-generally-available-in-github-models/) reveals that GPT-5 will have “enhanced agentic capabilities” and can handle “complex coding tasks with minimal prompting.”

[![Image 9: GitHub also compared GPT-5 to Llama 4 Scout and Cohere v2.](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gpt5githubmodels.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gpt5githubmodels.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

_GitHub also compared GPT-5 to Llama 4 Scout and Cohere v2._

GPT-5 will have four model variants, according to GitHub:

*   **gpt-5**: Designed for logic and multi-step tasks.
*   **gpt-5-mini**: A lightweight version for cost-sensitive applications.
*   **gpt-5-nano**: Optimized for speed and ideal for applications requiring low latency.
*   **gpt-5-chat**: Designed for advanced, natural, multimodal, and context-aware conversations for enterprise applications.

I revealed last month that OpenAI was [preparing to launch GPT-5 in early August](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad), complete with mini and nano versions that will also be available through its API. Earlier this week multiple OpenAI employees [started teasing](https://www.theverge.com/news/718147/openai-teasing-gpt-5-release) that it would be a big week, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even teased GPT-5 over the weekend.

OpenAI has all but confirmed it’s launching GPT-5 later today, [with the announcement](https://www.theverge.com/news/720114/openai-gpt-5-launch-event-tease) of a “LIVE5TREAM” for 10AM PT / 1PM ET. OpenAI’s GPT-5 launch comes in the same week the company also delivered two [GPT-OSS open-weight models](https://www.theverge.com/openai/718785/openai-gpt-oss-open-model-release), with one small enough to run locally on a PC.
