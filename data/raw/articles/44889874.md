# Real-Time State Management. Without the Backend Hassle.

Vaultrice is a globally distributed key-value store with a familiar API, built for real-time collaboration. Stop wiring together databases and WebSocket servers — get a complete solution in one simple, powerful package.

🚀Low Latency

🌍Global Edge Network

⚡Real-time Sync

NonLocalStorageSyncObject

NonLocalStorage API

Copy

```javascript
import { NonLocalStorage } from '@vaultrice/sdk';
const nls = new NonLocalStorage(credentials, 'shared-object-id');

// Set a value from one client...
await nls.setItem('hello', 'world from client A');

// ...and listen for it on another.
nls.on('setItem', 'hello', (item) => {
  console.log(item.value); // 'world from client A'
});
```

## How It Works

Go from idea to live, collaborative app in minutes. Our architecture is designed to make real-time simple and scalable.

### 1\. Define Your State

Use the simple `setItem()` API that feels just like `localStorage`. Store strings, numbers, or complex JSON objects with ease.

### 2\. Sync Instantly

Any change to your data is instantly broadcast over a persistent WebSocket connection to all subscribed clients. No polling, no manual refresh.

### 3\. Collaborate Everywhere

State is seamlessly synced across all tabs, devices, and even different domains, making it perfect for building unified user experiences.

## Everything You Need, Built-in.

**⚙️ Familiar API ⚡ Built-in Real-Time 🛡️ Secure by Default.**

If you know `localStorage`, you know Vaultrice. Get up and running in minutes with a simple, intuitive API that doesn't get in your way. Live data sync and a full Presence API are included. No need to integrate or pay for a separate WebSocket provider. From default transport encryption (TLS) to optional client-side End-to-End Encryption, you choose the level of security your data needs.

## What Will You Build?

Vaultrice is flexible, but it's purpose-built to solve common developer challenges.

## Cross-Domain User State

Share user preferences, session state, or a shopping cart across multiple domains or subdomains.

NonLocalStorageSyncObject

NonLocalStorage API

Copy

```javascript
// On site-a.com
await userPrefs.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// On site-b.com, the change is instant
userPrefs.on('setItem', 'theme', (item) => {
  // item.value is 'dark'
});
```

## Collaborative Applications

Build real-time features like "who's online" lists, shared to-do apps, or simple multiplayer game lobbies with our integrated Presence API.

Copy

```javascript
// See who's currently viewing the document
await nls.join({ name: 'Alice' });

nls.on('presence:join', (conn) => {
  // console.log(`${conn.data.name} is now online.`);
});

const connections = await nls.getJoinedConnections();
console.log(`${connections.length} users online`);
connections.forEach(user => {
  console.log(`${user.data.name} joined at ${new Date(user.joinedAt)}`);
});
```

## Real-Time Feature Flags

Enable or disable application features instantly for all users without deploying new code.

NonLocalStorage API

Copy

```javascript
// In your admin panel
await featureFlags.setItem('enableNewDashboard', true);

// In your client app
if (await featureFlags.getItem('enableNewDashboard')) {
  // show new dashboard
}
```
