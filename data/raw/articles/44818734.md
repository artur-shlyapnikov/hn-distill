Fetch and sync individual files or globs from other Git repositories, with commit tracking and local-change protection

**git-fetch-file(1)** is a utility for importing specific files from other Git repositories into your own project while keeping a manifest (.git-remote-files) that remembers where they came from and what commit they belong to.

Itâ€™s like a mini submodule, but for just the files you want.

Features
--------

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#features)
*   Pull a single file or glob from a remote Git repo
*   Track origin, commit, and comments in .git-remote-files
*   Optionally overwrite local changes with `--force`
*   Update tracked commits with `--save`
*   **Dry-run mode** to preview changes without executing them
*   **Concurrent fetching** with configurable parallelism (`--jobs`)
*   **Git-style output** with clean, organized status reporting
*   Simple CLI interface that feels like native git commands

Installation
------------

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#installation)
### Option 1: Git Alias (Recommended)

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#option-1-git-alias-recommended)
Save the script anywhere and set up a Git alias:

git config --global alias.fetch-file '!python3 /path/to/git-fetch-file.py'

Then run it like this:

git fetch-file <subcommand> [args...]

### Option 2: PATH Installation

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#option-2-path-installation)
Save the script as `git-fetch-file` somewhere on your PATH.

Commands
--------

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#commands)
### git fetch-file add

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#git-fetch-file-add)
Track a file (or glob) from a remote Git repository.

**SYNOPSIS**

```
git fetch-file add <repo> <path> [<target_dir>] [<options>]
```

**DESCRIPTION**

Adds a file or glob pattern from a remote Git repository to the tracking manifest (`.git-remote-files`). The file will be downloaded on the next `pull` operation.

**OPTIONS**

`--commit <commit>` : Specify a commit, branch, or tag to track. Defaults to `HEAD`.

`--glob` : Treat `<path>` as a glob pattern. Overrides auto-detection.

`--no-glob` : Treat `<path>` as a literal filename. Overrides auto-detection.

`--comment <text>` : Add a descriptive comment to the manifest entry.

`--dry-run` : Show what would be added without actually modifying the manifest.

### git fetch-file pull

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#git-fetch-file-pull)
Download all tracked files from their respective repositories.

**SYNOPSIS**

```
git fetch-file pull [<options>]
```

**DESCRIPTION**

Fetches all files tracked in `.git-remote-files` from their source repositories. Files are downloaded to their configured target locations and local changes are detected automatically.

By default, changes are not automatically committed (following git's convention). Use `--commit` for auto-commit with a git-style default message, `-m`, `--edit`, or other commit flags to enable auto-commit after pulling files.

**OPTIONS**

`--force` : Overwrite files with local changes. Without this flag, files with local modifications are skipped.

`--save` : Update commit hashes in `.git-remote-files` for branch/tag references that have moved.

`--dry-run` : Show what would be fetched without actually downloading files.

`--jobs=<n>` : Number of parallel jobs for fetching. Default is 4, like git's default parallelism.

`--commit` : Auto-commit changes with a git-style default message that includes information about what was fetched (e.g., "Update README.md", "Update utils.js and config.json", "Update 5 files in src/").

`-m <message>`, `--message=<message>` : Auto-commit changes with the specified commit message.

`--edit` : Open editor to write commit message for auto-commit.

`--no-commit` : Don't auto-commit changes, even if other commit flags are specified.

### git fetch-file status

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#git-fetch-file-status)
View all tracked files in a clean, git-style format.

**SYNOPSIS**

```
git fetch-file status
git fetch-file list
```

**DESCRIPTION**

Lists all files currently tracked in `.git-remote-files` with their source repositories and commit information. The output format is similar to `git remote -v`.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**

```
<path>[<indicators>]    <repository> (<commit>) [# <comment>]
```

Where:

*   `<indicators>` may include `(glob)` for glob patterns and `-> <target>` for custom target directories
*   `<commit>` is truncated to 7 characters for display
*   `<comment>` is shown if present in the manifest

.git-remote-files
-----------------

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#git-remote-files)
Each tracked file is recorded in .git-remote-files (INI format). Example entry:

[file "lib/util.py"]
repo = https://github.com/example/tools.git
commit = a1b2c3d
target = vendor
comment = Common utility function

This file should be committed to your repository.

Performance & Workflow
----------------------

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#performance--workflow)
### Concurrent Operations

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#concurrent-operations)
git-fetch-file supports concurrent downloading for better performance:

*   Default: 4 parallel jobs (like git's default)
*   Configurable with `--jobs=<n>`
*   Particularly effective when fetching from multiple repositories
*   Thread-safe with proper error isolation

### Dry-Run Mode

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#dry-run-mode)
Always preview changes before execution:

*   `--dry-run` shows exactly what would happen
*   Validates repository access
*   Detects conflicts and local changes
*   No side effects - safe to run anytime

### Git-Style Integration

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#git-style-integration)
Designed to feel like native git commands:

*   Familiar argument patterns (`--force`, `--jobs`, etc.)
*   Clean, organized output without visual clutter
*   Error and warning messages follow git conventions
*   Works seamlessly with git aliases

Examples
--------

### Advanced Features

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#advanced-features)
#### Preview what would be added (dry-run)

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#preview-what-would-be-added-dry-run)

git fetch-file add https://github.com/user/project.git "src/*.js" --glob --dry-run

Output:

```
Would validate repository access: https://github.com/user/project.git
Repository access confirmed
Would add glob pattern src/*.js from https://github.com/user/project.git (commit: HEAD)
```

#### Preview what would be pulled

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#preview-what-would-be-pulled)

git fetch-file pull --dry-run

Output:

```
Would fetch:
  src/utils.js from https://github.com/user/library.git (a1b2c3d -> [new commit])
  config/webpack.js from https://github.com/company/tools.git (HEAD -> [latest])

Would skip (local changes):
  docs/README.md from https://github.com/org/templates.git (use --force to overwrite)

Up to date:
  package.json from https://github.com/user/library.git (f4e5d6c)
```

#### Fast concurrent pulling

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#fast-concurrent-pulling)

# Use 8 parallel jobs for faster fetching
git fetch-file pull --jobs=8

# Conservative single-threaded mode
git fetch-file pull --jobs=1

#### Auto-commit changes

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#auto-commit-changes)

# Pull and auto-commit with informative git-style default messages:
# - Single file: "Update README.md" 
# - Two files: "Update utils.js and config.json"
# - Multiple files: "Update 5 files in src/"
# - With commit info: "Update package.json to a1b2c3d"
git fetch-file pull --commit

# Pull and commit with a custom message
git fetch-file pull -m "Update vendor dependencies"

# Pull and open editor for commit message
git fetch-file pull --edit

# Pull with pre-filled commit message in editor
git fetch-file pull -m "Update dependencies" --edit

# Pull without committing (default behavior)
git fetch-file pull --no-commit

#### Track glob patterns

[](https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/git-fetch-file#track-glob-patterns)

# Track all JavaScript files in src/
git fetch-file add https://github.com/user/project.git "src/*.js" --glob --comment "Source files"

# Auto-detection works too (detects glob characters)
git fetch-file add https://github.com/user/project.git "docs/**/*.md"
