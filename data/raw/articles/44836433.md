Welcome to SynchrotronUI!
-------------------------

Ã—

SynchrotronUI is a graphical editor for the [Synchrotron](https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/Synchrotron) node-based audio engine.

Here's how to quickly get started:

1.   **Run synchrotron-server** locally in your terminal: 
```
$ pip install synchrotron
                            $ synchrotron-server
```
 This should change the connection state in the top right from Disconnected to Connected. 

 (Yes, it seems odd that I'm asking you to install something to run what looks like a browser tool, but Synchrotron doesn't run in the browser!)
2.   Once you're connected, type **demo** into the bottom console to load a demo graph.
3.   Hit **Start** in the top right (or use the _start_ command in the console) to hear the graph!
4.   Tinker about with the graph! Load up another [example project](https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/Synchrotron/tree/main/examples), edit the links in the graph, or create some new nodes with e.g. _new SineNode_.
