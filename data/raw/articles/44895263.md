## True Pigment

*   [Dual component pigment canvas](https://WellObserve.com/index.php?post=20250411214820) enables accurate color mixing in with both opaque and transparent colors.
*   Most flexible color mixing algorithm so far in open source digital painting programs\*2

Full pixel dual component pigment canvas works by storing spectral reflectance and transmittance of pigment into Sub-pixels, and when forming the final image, those pixels are combined to generate a physically accurate RGB value for display.

## Opaque and transparencies, at the same time.

Use opaque color for impasto, or glazing over with transparencies, any process, any time.

## Fresh out of tube, maybe add water too.

Different reflectance behaviour for dense/diluted colors, enjoy the hue shifts as you mix.

*   One click real-time CMYK soft proofing for all supported display and canvas color spaces. Allow user imported CMYK icc/icm color profiles.
*   Support reading EDID information from connected monitor and use monitor specified color space.\*8

\*5: Linux: X11 only, require the entire desktop to output entire RGB range / is in sRGB.  
\*6: Windows: require the entire desktop to output entire RGB range / is in sRGB.  
\*7: Canvas pixel value color space choice only available in RGB canvas mode.  
\*8: Linux only. Not all monitors report correct color space info with their EDID.
