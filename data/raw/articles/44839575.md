# All known \-year-old Apple-1 computer

[Mission statement](../index.html) and [information](../en/theapple1.html) for first-time visitors not familiar with the iconic first Apple computer. The Apple-1 Registry is a non-profit website. [About components](../interactive/apple-1.html) on the Apple-1 mainboard.  
  
It took well over a thousand man-hours to gather all the information and pictures, contact the owners of the Apple-1, visit or meet some in person, etc. The maintenance of the website and database is extremely complex.  
  
If you like it or appreciate the work, please spread the word about the Apple-1 Registry by [adding a link](../en/press.html#linking) to your social media account and/or website. **[Contact](../en/contact.html) us if you have new information about any Apple-1 (parts) for sale.**  
This website does not use cookies, does not track you, there are no advertisements, and it is hosted in the European Union.

**Statistics**  
**070** verified Apple-1

### Notes

\= location, \= [batch](../en/theapple1.html#batch), [numbers/stamps/labels](../en/theapple1.html#serial), \= verification status, \= picture and video count, \= available history, [\= auctions](../en/market.html#auctions).  
**'More or less verified':** To the best of our knowledge and belief, evidence is almost given or obvious. Many times the current owner is unknown, pictures might be old, etc.!  
**Unlisted Apple-1:** The Apple-1 Registry is in contact with some owners who wish to have no information published. We respect this. Unknown Apple-1 might exist as well.  
**Naming:** Because there is no serial number on all Apple-1, every Apple-1 has a unique name. The name of the Apple-1 should be the first owner; if not available, the name of the last owner or last known location. Last resort is the sequential number.  
**Working condition:** Most Apple-1 could be operational again – depending on how much effort you spend or how many parts you are willing to change.  
**Last operation:** The year of last operation is not listed for good reason. After every power-up, no Apple-1 owner would announce this to the Apple-1 Registry, and this information would become obsolete very soon.  
**Accuracy:** No guarantee can be given for the accuracy of any information. If you have more information, please feel free to [contact](../en/contact.html) us. Many very good replicas of Apple-1 exist, even with date code–correct components. Anyone interested in buying an Apple-1 has to keep this in mind. Hobbyists usually build replicas for private use. Even some museums use replicas.  
**Auction:** Only successful auctions since the year 2000 are considered.  
**Production:** All Apple-1 were produced in two batches in spring and fall 1976. There was **no serial number** issued by Apple. Apple Computer supplied only the mainboard, Cassette Interface Adapter, and manuals. No case, power supply, or keyboard. The Apple-1 was the first Apple computer and the beginning of a success story.  
**Number of existing Apple-1:** It may look like many Apple-1 are available, but it's getting harder to buy an Apple-1 every year. Many Apple-1 are now owned by museums or companies and will never be for sale again. In the coming years, more and more Apple-1 will 'disappear' from the market, because fewer Apple-1s will have private owners. Someday it will be nearly impossible to buy an Apple-1.  
**Lost Apple-1:** Some information about destroyed or lost Apple-1 exists. More about it [here](../en/theapple1.html#lost).  
  
**Last update:** Jul 29, 2025. [Change log](../en/changelog.html) for all Apple-1.  
**Technical info:** For much better performance, all pictures are significantly reduced in size by the admin using efficient compression tools for pictures shown on the web.

**If you have pictures and/or information about any Apple-1, it would be very kind to share it with us.**
