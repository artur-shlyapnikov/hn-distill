In a significant move to bolster the domestic supply chain, a New Jersey-based company, Princeton NuEnergy, has unveiled a groundbreaking battery recycling facility in Chester, South Carolina. This facility marks a milestone as the United States’ first commercial-scale Advanced Black Mass and battery-grade cathode active material production facility. With a remarkable recycling yield exceeding 97%, the site is set to play a pivotal role in regenerating and producing critical battery minerals domestically. As the push towards a circular battery economy intensifies, this facility stands at the forefront of innovation, heralding a new era in sustainable energy practices.

## Recovery Yield Surpasses Industry Norms

Princeton NuEnergy’s new facility in Chester has set a new benchmark in battery materials recovery and manufacturing. According to Dr. Chao Yan, the company’s co-founder and CEO, the facility demonstrates that the United States can lead in this arena today, rather than years from now. With a recovery yield that surpasses industry norms, this site is not just another addition to the battery supply chain; it is a giant leap forward. The facility is fully compliant with regulatory standards and offers high-value downstream feedstock for battery production.

In Princeton, New Jersey, the company has launched the largest Materials Testing Center in the U.S. northeast. This center provides third-party validation and testing, accelerating battery manufacturing across the country. Notably, PNE’s low-temperature plasma-assisted separation process (LPAS) significantly reduces costs and environmental impacts compared to conventional methods. By achieving a 38% cost reduction and a 69% lower environmental footprint, PNE is setting a new standard for sustainable battery manufacturing.

## Operations Advance Circular Battery Economy

Princeton NuEnergy’s operations are pivotal in advancing a circular battery economy, ensuring a secure U.S. battery supply chain. This approach keeps materials within the country, from production to end-of-life recycling and remanufacturing. The facility sources battery feedstock from various consumer and industrial goods, including mobile phones, computers, and electric vehicles.

The company’s patented LPAS process is cleaner, faster, and more sustainable than traditional recycling methods. Recovering nearly 97% of lithium-ion materials, this process not only enhances efficiency but also reduces costs and environmental impacts. Originating from research at Princeton University, PNE’s direct recycling process is poised to transform the future of battery production, offering a viable alternative to traditional methods and supporting the U.S. in achieving energy independence.
