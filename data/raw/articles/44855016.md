# This Mesmerizing Hypnoloid, a Kinetic Desktop Sculpture

## It moves in a very unexpected way

By [Rain Noe](https://codex.core77.com/users/Rain-Noe) - August 6

in [Object Culture](https://www.core77.com/Object-Culture?utm_source=from_tags)

This [Hypnoloid](https://hypnotiqofficial.com/products/hypnoloid-kinetic-desk-sculpture) object is sort of the opposite of a spinning top.

Whereas a top contacts the surface it's balancing on only at its point, the Hypnoloid contacts the surface with every square millimeter of its surface area.

The shape is called an oloid, and it's a bit difficult to understand. The 20th-century German sculptor, inventor and mathematician Paul Schatz, who discovered it, describes it thusly: "If the distance of two centers of disk is equal to the radius, then the convex hull produces another figure that rolls smooth and is known as the oloid."

The Hypnoloid is CNC-machined out of aluminum and sold by kinetic products manufacturer Hypnotiq.

They run $70.
