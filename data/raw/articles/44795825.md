Title: ‎uBlock Origin Lite

URL Source: https://apps.apple.com/app/ublock-origin-lite/id6745342698

Markdown Content:
uBO Lite (uBOL) is a reliable and efficient content blocker.

The default ruleset corresponds to uBlock Origin's default filterset:

- uBlock Origin's built-in filter lists

- EasyList

- EasyPrivacy

- Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list

You can enable more rulesets by visiting the options page -- click the _Cogs_ icon in the popup panel.

uBOL is entirely declarative, meaning there is no need for a permanent uBOL process for the filtering to occur, and CSS/JS injection-based content filtering is performed reliably by the browser itself rather than by the extension. This means that uBOL itself does not consume CPU/memory resources while content blocking is ongoing -- uBOL's service worker process is required _only_ when you interact with the popup panel or the option pages.

### Best adblocker for safari

> Open source, based off of the original ublock origin, and faster than any other adblocker I’ve tried for safari. Highly recommend. Make sure you set your filtering mode to complete, otherwise you’ll still see some ads.

### Unable to turn it on on laptop Safari after installation. Have to install macOs updates…Fix this pls

> On iPhone works great, thanks. Improve pls macOs version. I can’t checked it in safari settings it looks like disabled right after installation.

### Dashboard access

> It’s a bit counter-intuitive to get into the settings of the extension. Especially in Private Mode. However, this is the best adblocker in the world and everyone knows it. Thank you for finally porting it to iOS.
