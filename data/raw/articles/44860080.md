[Nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/) is an unusual web browser that tries to answer the question, "what if Emacs was a _good_ web browser?". Nyxt is not an Emacs package, but a full web browser written in Common Lisp and available under the BSD three-clause license. Its target audience is developers who want a browser that is keyboard-driven and extensible; Nyxt is also developed for Linux first, rather than Linux being an afterthought or just a sliver of its audience. The philosophy (as described in its [FAQ](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/faq)) behind the project is that users should be able to customize all of the browser's functionality.

#### Background

Nyxt was started in 2017 by John Mercouris, and is currently sponsored as a project by [Atlas](https://atlas.engineer/about), which seems to be a two-person business focusing on Common Lisp development. The team consists of Mercouris and André A. Gomes. The [post about Nyxt's origins](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/article-how-can-i-make-emacs-my-web-browser.org) states that it was built by Emacs users and developed to provide "a good Emacs experience while using the Internet". It is meant to enable user freedom not only through its license, but also by focusing on the browser's "hackability" so users can fully control the browser:

> Nyxt and Emacs take a different approach than Unix. Instead of doing one thing and doing it well, Nyxt and Emacs share a core foundation built upon extensibility. They are designed to be introspected, changed, and hacked on the fly.

With Emacs being a heavy influence on Nyxt, one might wonder why it isn't developed as an Emacs package or browser extension rather than as a standalone project. In 2021, contributor Pedro Delfino and Mercouris addressed that question in a [blog post](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/why-building-nyxt-instead-of-an-emacs-package.org). In short, despite all of its merits, Mercouris felt that Emacs had too much technical debt to make a good basis for a web browser, and wanted to start with a clean slate. He also wanted to make Nyxt welcoming to non-Emacs users, which meant that it would be a bad idea to require people to use Emacs in order to run Nyxt. It should be noted that Nyxt has support for vi-like keybindings as well as [common user access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access) (CUA) keybindings.

According to their FAQ, it was not possible to develop Nyxt as a browser extension, either:

> It would not be able to utilize Lisp as a powerful and modern language (a source of many of Nyxt's powerful features). Additionally, many of Nyxt's features are simply not possible due to restrictions in plugin-architecture.

The current stable version of Nyxt is 3.12.0, which was [released](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/releases/tag/3.12.0) in October 2024. The 3.x series uses [WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/) as its rendering engine, with experimental support for [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_\(browser_engine\)). The project's [security policy](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/security) is terse and to the point: only the latest stable version of Nyxt will receive security updates. There is no announcement list specifically for security issues, and the project requests that vulnerability reports be sent to hello@atlas.engineer.

The 3.x series appears to be in maintenance mode at this point, with work focused on a 4.0 release series that was [unveiled](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/releases/tag/4.0.0-pre-release-1) at the end of December. The 4.0 pre-releases support two renderers: WebKitGTK and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). According to the [blog post](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/release-4.0.0-pre-release-1.org) by Gomes announcing the first preview release, 4.0 will mark "a new era for Nyxt" as a "renderer-agnostic web browser". The project is adding Electron due to shortcomings in WebKitGTK's performance. This has required the project to improve its API "in order to achieve render agnosticism". The move to Electron, said Gomes, will provide better performance as well as support for macOS and Windows.

The latest preview release ([4.0.0-pre-release-8](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/releases/tag/4.0.0-pre-release-8)) is only available as an AppImage with Electron as the rendering engine. Users who wish to use the WebKitGTK version will need to compile from source. Users should not expect a bunch of new features or functionality in the first stable 4.0 release; the bulk of the work seems to be refactoring for Electron support, bug fixes, and user-interface improvements.

#### Getting Nyxt

The recommended way to install the stable release of Nyxt for Linux is via [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/engineer.atlas.Nyxt). (Despite offering an AppImage for preview releases, there is no AppImage for the stable series.) The project also maintains a list of [packages](https://repology.org/project/nyxt/versions) for a variety of Linux distributions, but asks that any bugs found in third-party packages be reported to the distribution rather than the Nyxt project.

Compiling from source is also an option, of course, and might even be a necessity. The Nyxt Flatpak package would not run on Fedora 41 on a system with an NVIDIA card without disabling WebKit compositing and sandboxing using the following command:

    $ flatpak run --env=WEBKIT\_DISABLE\_COMPOSITING\_MODE=1 \\
      --env=WEBKIT\_DISABLE\_SANDBOX\_THIS\_IS\_DANGEROUS=1 \\
      engineer.atlas.Nyxt

Starting Nyxt with a variable that explicitly informs the user "this is dangerous" seemed unwise over the long term, so I went ahead and compiled Nyxt myself for that machine. The [developer manual](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/developer-manual.org) has information on dependencies that might be needed and that are unlikely to be installed by default. To enable copy and paste functions under Wayland, it will be necessary to install the [Wayland clipboard utilities](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) in addition to any dependencies needed to compile Nyxt. On Fedora, this is the wl-clipboard package.

For this article, I primarily used Nyxt 3.12, though I did spend some time with the 4.0.x preview releases as well. As one might expect, they are still too unstable to use full-time.

#### Getting started

When Nyxt is started, it displays a page with four buttons: Quick-Start, Describe-Bindings, Manual, and Settings. Unlike Chrome, Firefox, and other popular web browsers, Nyxt does not have a point-and-click interface for all (or even most) of its features; the expectation is that users are going to do almost everything from the keyboard, and much of Nyxt's functionality is _only_ accessible by using key combinations or entering commands. Users can still use the mouse to click links, etc., but there are no buttons to open new windows, add bookmarks, and no URL bar or location bar to type "lwn.net" into.

The quick start introduces some of the concepts that set Nyxt apart from other browsers. Instead of tabs, Nyxt has [buffers](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#buffers). In practice, buffers are similar to tabs, except that a Nyxt buffer can have its own behavior and settings. For instance, users can set a buffer's keybindings individually to use a different set than the global default. Likewise, a buffer can use different [modes](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#modes)—which are similar to Emacs modes.

Nyxt commands are invoked with keybindings or by bringing up the [prompt buffer](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#prompt-buffer) and typing the command to be used. Users can summon the prompt buffer with Ctrl-Space and Alt-x if using Emacs mode or : in vi mode. Users can see the modes that are enabled in a buffer by bringing up the prompt buffer and using the toggle-modes command.

> [![[Nyxt with prompt buffer open]](https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/nyxt-sm.png "Nyxt with prompt buffer open")](/Articles/1023878/)

The Settings page, which can be opened from the Nyxt start page or by running the common-settings command in the prompt buffer, has several tabs for configuring high-level Nyxt options. These include the browser's default keybindings, the theme (dark or light), its privacy settings, and the text editor. Nyxt comes with an ad-blocker mode, but it needs to be enabled in the privacy settings. Users can also set the cookie policy, turn on the reduce-tracking mode, and turn off JavaScript if desired with the no-script mode. And, of course, each of these settings can be enabled or disabled on a per-buffer basis as well.

Even though Nyxt developers have a strong preference for Emacs, it is set to use CUA keybindings by default. Folks who prefer Emacs or vi-like bindings will want to change the keybinding setting and restart the browser for that to take effect. (Note that users can change the keybindings (or other modes) in a buffer without having to restart—a restart is only required for the global setting.) It's best to do this early, rather than committing the CUA keybindings to memory and then relearning them later for vi or Emacs. It will likely make Nyxt more intuitive as well—I found that it was relatively easy to make the move from [Firefox with Vimium](https://lwn.net/Articles/1005332/#vimium) to Nyxt. The CUA bindings, aside from some familiar ones like Ctrl-l to enter a URL to browse to, were much harder (for me, anyway) to commit to memory.

Over the years, a lot of work has been done to reduce the amount of space that is taken up by browser "chrome"—that is, the user-interface components (UI) such as window title bars, toolbars, tabs, and so forth—to maximize the amount of space available for the web pages being viewed. Nyxt solves this by having almost no UI at all while browsing, though there are a few tiny buttons in a small toolbar at the bottom of the Nyxt window. The toolbar has elements for navigating backward or forward, reloading the page, raising the command prompt, and for displaying the modes enabled in each buffer. Nyxt also has a minimal right-click menu that lets users move one page backward or forward in a buffer, reload a buffer, or bring up the [WebKit Inspector tools](https://webkit.org/web-inspector/).

One feature Nyxt has that other browser makers should copy is the history tree. Running the history-tree command will bring up a navigable tree-type visualization of the browser's history across all buffers. This not only lets users trace their steps and quickly hop back (or forward) to pages they've visited, Nyxt can operate on the history with other commands, such as bookmark-buffer-url to bookmark pages that are currently open in the browser.

Just as with Emacs and Vim, users can operate on multiple buffers at once. After a long browsing session, for instance, one might have 20 pages open from Wikipedia after going down a rabbit hole about a topic. Open the command buffer, enter the delete-buffer command, and Nyxt will list all open buffers. Type "wikipedia" and it will list only those buffers that match the term; select each one and hit Enter, and they will all be closed. The same is true for other commands, of course. Instead of closing all buffers, a user could choose to bookmark all pages matching certain terms, or to use the print-buffer command to send them all to the printer.

#### Extending Nyxt

Firefox and Chrome allow developers to add features to the browser as extensions, but there are limits to what developers can do within the boundaries of the extension frameworks for each browser. Nyxt, on the other hand, is designed to be entirely customizable and extensible via Lisp. Nyxt targets the [Steel Bank Common Lisp](https://www.sbcl.org/) (SBCL) implementation. Users can create their own [URL-dispatchers](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#url-dispatchers) to configure applications to handle certain types of URLs, or even create [custom URL scheme handlers](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#custom-url-schemes) to deal with URL schemes that Nyxt doesn't know about. Users can also create [custom commands](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#custom-commands), add new menu entries to the right-click menu, and (of course) [add and modify keybindings](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#keybinding-configuration). Nyxt also features a [built-in REPL](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#built-in-repl) to run Lisp code in the browser.

Nyxt will automatically load configurations and code from the user's config.lisp file, usually found under ~/.config/nyxt. As a short example, this code will add an item to the right-click menu to bookmark the current page:

    (define-command-global my-bookmark-url
        nil
      "Query which URL to bookmark."
      (let ((url
             (prompt :prompt "Bookmark URL" :sources
                     'prompter:raw-source)))
        (nyxt/mode/bookmark:bookmark-current-url)))
    
    (ffi-add-context-menu-command 'my-bookmark-url "Bookmark")

One of the great things about both Emacs and Vim is that each editor has a large community of users, many of whom like to share their knowledge about using and extending their editor of choice. New users can find copious amounts of documentation and examples online to learn from or copy and modify as needed. The odds are that anything one might want to do with Emacs or Vim has already been done and blogged about with examples for others to copy.

That is decidedly not true of Nyxt, at least not yet. There are not many people blogging about Nyxt and few examples online that I could find. Few, but not zero. Artyom Bologov has a [repository](https://github.com/aartaka/nyxt-config/tree/master) with a treasure-trove of Nyxt configuration files, as well as a [separate repository](https://github.com/aartaka/nx-search-engines/tree/master) for adding search engines to Nyxt. These are bound to be helpful for many new Nyxt users, but the bad news is that Bologov [stopped using Nyxt](https://www.aartaka.me.eu.org/nyxt-to-surf) in favor of the [surf](https://surf.suckless.org/) browser from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/). The examples are still useful today, but will become less so as Nyxt evolves.

Nyxt also lacks the kind of extension ecosystem that other browsers enjoy. It is possible to create extensions for Nyxt, but the project only lists [two extensions](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/extensions) currently—and both are created by Atlas.

#### Notes on Nyxt

It takes some time to get used to using Nyxt after using a browser like Chrome or Firefox full-time. It took several sessions with Nyxt before I felt productive with it, and a few more to really appreciate its features.

Nyxt's performance is notably slower than Firefox or Chrome on some sites. For example, using the date-picker widget on GitHub, posting content to Mastodon, and browsing [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) was sluggish compared to Firefox. Nyxt is probably not suitable as a primary browser replacement if one's work (or play) involves a lot of JavaScript-heavy web applications. It also [lacks WebRTC support](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/faq#:~:text=WebRTC), so users need to look elsewhere for video conferencing.

On the other hand, it's quite usable for most of my day-to-day work with LWN and performs well on sites, like [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/), that have minimal JavaScript. It seems likely it would be a suitable option as a primary browser for many system administrators and developers.

The Electron port should offer a better experience once it has stabilized. I tried it on GitHub and Mastodon and didn't experience the same slowdowns that I ran into with the stable series.

Nyxt has an [online manual](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation) that is also included with the browser to help users dig more deeply into its functionality. It is only fully usable when viewed with Nyxt; links to commands and functions are prefixed with nyxt: to point to internal documents, so they do not work when viewed with other browsers from the Nyxt web site. Unfortunately, the manual is outdated in spots, and that can lead to frustration. As an example, it explains how users can [customize settings with the "Configure" button](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#configuration), but that [feature was removed](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/3487).

It's not entirely surprising that the documentation has fallen out of date in places: Nyxt is an ambitious project and only has a few active developers. Only seven people have contributed to the [Nyxt repository on GitHub](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt) since June 4 last year, with Mercouris and Gomes responsible for all but 13 of the 633 commits; one of the other contributors has nine commits, the rest only have one each.

The 4.0 series does not have a target date for a stable release, but a list of [GitHub issues tagged for the 4.0 series](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues?q=is:issue%20label:4-series) suggests that the project is making good progress toward it. There are currently 17 open issues and 46 closed issues, and there have been 4.0.0 development versions released about every two to three weeks since December.

Nyxt has received some funding from the European Union's [Next Generation Internet](https://www.ngi.eu/) initiative and has a plan to raise additional funding by [selling applications](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/sustainable-open-source.org) that use Nyxt as an application framework. The first application is an RSS feed reader called [Demeter](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/extension/demeter.org). It is not open source, but it is offered under a "pay-what-you-can" model, with a suggested price of $10—and a link to a [direct download](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/extension/demeter.org/download) to the source for users who cannot afford to pay. As a business strategy, Atlas's approach is fairly user-friendly but unlikely to generate a huge revenue stream.

Like Emacs and Vim, Nyxt is not for everyone—it takes more time than most would want to invest to really explore the features it has to offer and even longer to start making it one's own through customization. Also, like Emacs and Vim, it has the promise of letting users mold the application exactly to their specifications if they are willing to expend the time and effort to do so.

I wonder how hard this would be to embed in Emacs proper. Seems like it'd integrate well.

It's written in Common Lisp, not Elisp, so probably quite a challenge.

No moreso than a program written in any other language.  

### MV2

Posted Jun 7, 2025 11:41 UTC (Sat) by **q3cpma** (subscriber, #120859) \[[Link](/Articles/1024430/)\]

Still extremely interested in it and ready to donate once it can do what Firefox uBlock does, but I'm very worried about that fact that it's based on Electron which will (like all Chromium derivatives) deprecates MV2 in the near future.  

Also, looks like its crew lost an important member recently: [https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/0a484e63a64...](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/0a484e63a648b22e0a36de80dde5b93afc27f73a)  

### It's a trap

Posted Jun 7, 2025 20:24 UTC (Sat) by **NightMonkey** (subscriber, #23051) \[[Link](/Articles/1024455/)\]

Just when I finally was able to quit Vim, along comes this new OS Emacs and I can't even use Nyxt in it. :eyeroll:  

### Keyboard-driven web browsers

Posted Jun 8, 2025 6:33 UTC (Sun) by **greenfoo** (subscriber, #127445) \[[Link](/Articles/1024476/)\] (1 responses)

Unfortunately, both the 3.x version (WebKitGTK) and the 4.x alpha (Electron) are extremely sluggish. I would say that, for keyboard-driven web browsers, the options we have so far are:  

1\. Firefox + Vimium: Great performance and ad-blocking capabilities, but not so great keyboard integration.  

2\. Qutebrowser: Great keyboard integration, but a bit sluggish and not so great ad-blocking capabilities.  

3\. Nyxt: Outstanding keyboard integration and configurability, but terrible performance/compatibility and not so great ad-blocking capabilities.  

Currently, I use Qutebrowser as my daily driver for personal browsing, but I have to revert to Firefox + Vimium for work-related tasks, where having dozens of open tabs that make heavy use of JavaScript is the norm.  

Given the current situation, I think what will eventually happen is that someone will create a Firefox fork with great keyboard integration. Floorp is heading in that direction, but it's not there yet... though I wouldn’t hold my breath :)  

### Keyboard-driven web browsers

Posted Jun 12, 2025 13:36 UTC (Thu) by **elw** (subscriber, #86388) \[[Link](/Articles/1025148/)\]

I've found the same thing to be true for me as well. On my personal laptop, Qutebrowser is my go-to but only because my use case for a browser on my personal laptop is relatively small. I've added the qute-lastpass and readability userscripts and can get by quite well. As you said, however, it is sluggish and I find myself always looking around to find something different.  

I tried out Nyxt very briefly a few weeks ago and found it absolutely abysmal to use. Perhaps I didn't give it a fair shake, or my brain is too far corrupted by vim, but it just felt very clunky and hard to use compared to qutebrowser, even with it's faults. It does seem like an interesting project, however, with a laudable goal of improving the state of keyboard driven browsers so I will be keeping my eye on it as things evolve. Maybe one day it'll supplant Qutebrowser.  

You also mention Firefox + Vimium but mention that the keyboard integration is not that great. I might suggest checking out Vimium-c or Tridactyle as alternatives. I, personally, use Vimium c as I've found it to have significantly less overhead than either vimium or tridactyle but each has it's strengths and weaknesses.  

### Ctrl-x/Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v is not CUA

Posted Jun 8, 2025 18:09 UTC (Sun) by **jem** (subscriber, #24231) \[[Link](/Articles/1024483/)\] (5 responses)

It's strange how the term "Common User Access" (CUA) has changed meaning from the original IBM keybindings to the current Windows keybindings, which in turn were copied from the Macintosh Command-\_ keybindings. The Nyxt manual says the browser uses CUA keybindings, and the LWN article repeats that, but links to the Wikipedia page describing the \*real\* CUA bindings: Shift-DEL for cut, Ctrl-INS for copy, and Shift-INS for paste. IBM should have applied for a trademark for CUA.  

### Ctrl-x/Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v is not CUA

Posted Jun 8, 2025 19:51 UTC (Sun) by **smoogen** (subscriber, #97) \[[Link](/Articles/1024488/)\] (2 responses)

I am reading through that list of commands, and I kind of remember them with DOS5 items but I don't ever remember ever seeing them implemented in AIX or s390 terminal programs.\[I am guessing OS/2 used it?\]  

Having commands like CUT being "Left Shift" and "DEL" is like putting your hands at opposite sides of the keyboard seems like having your hands off the keyboard for something done a lot. I am guessing that they were trying to make sure it didn't happen accidentally or require keys not available on different terminals (like a 3270) but I can see why Microsoft would move to something more like the Mac.  

### Ctrl-x/Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v is not CUA

Posted Jun 8, 2025 20:56 UTC (Sun) by **iabervon** (subscriber, #722) \[[Link](/Articles/1024491/)\] (1 responses)

Before people had mice, there would have to be a lot of cursor movement key presses in between these operations, which made them less common and also increased the chance that the right hand wouldn't be on the letter keys and would be around ins and del, and maybe even that the left hand would be on modifier keys as well. The Mac-originated commands make sense because they use the left hand while the right hand is on the mouse.  

### Ctrl-x/Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v is not CUA

Posted Jun 9, 2025 9:43 UTC (Mon) by **smoogen** (subscriber, #97) \[[Link](/Articles/1024508/)\]

I didn't think of that as I was thinking of serial terminals and other keyboards I used without arrow keys.  

### Ctrl-x/Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v is not CUA

Posted Jun 9, 2025 3:37 UTC (Mon) by **jzb** (editor, #7867) \[[Link](/Articles/1024497/)\] (1 responses)

I don't know that I'd call it _strange_, though it is interesting. I think that Shift+Del, Ctrl+Ins, and Shift+Ins still work on Windows—but I can't swear to that, and I don't have a Windows system handy to verify it. They work in Emacs' cua-mode alongside Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v, Ctrl-x, and in Firefox, GNOME's Text Editor, LibreOffice... and Alt-F4 is still a shortcut for "close window" in GNOME, so it doesn't seem that the originals have been removed so much as other shortcuts have been added to CUA.

Also, IBM [did apparently file a trademark application](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=74174369&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch) for Common User Access in 1991, but it was cancelled in 2003. (Or it was [abandoned](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=74176146&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch) in 1996, there are two entries...)

I've just tried shift-del and shift-ins on a Win 2022 and they do copy and paste.  

### Self-documenting?

Posted Jun 12, 2025 13:58 UTC (Thu) by **nbecker** (guest, #35200) \[[Link](/Articles/1025211/)\]

One of the biggest strengths of emacs is that it's functions are self-documenting and discoverable. You can use help on function or apropos to discover functions. Also the customization system makes it easy to discover how to customize different groups.
