With the rise of LLMs, I am seeing tech professionals blatantly skipping over the fundamentals.

For example, in my world of data analytics, SQL is table stakes.

Yet, I see people blindly trusting LLM outputs to develop SQL queries, without knowing how to explain or debug them.

I am getting increasingly impatient about how people and organizations are using LLMs.

I worry that we are being over sold on a promise that LLMs will magically make up for a lack of proficiency in an area. It can get you to the answer faster, but you still need to understand what is going on, if you want to pass it on as your work.

As organizations try to integrate AI into their processes, I hope that the fundamentals are not forgotten.

Maybe another industry of cleaning up vibe coded messes will be a thing? :-)
