is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Did Tesla remotely deactivate a Cybertruck in the middle of a highway because the owner featured it in an unauthorized music video? The story already seemed highly unlikely, and on Monday afternoon, Tesla [tweeted](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1954992987223757149?t=ySHgoE7tozr0eGDFHRrpaw&s=19) about the video, saying, ‚ÄúThis is fake ‚Äì that‚Äôs not our screen. Tesla does NOT disable vehicles remotely.‚Äù

On Sunday, Instagram user @bighuey313 [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNJTGxYuCEV/) of his supposed deactivated Cybertruck, complete with a flashing red warning message on the truck‚Äôs main touchscreen. ‚ÄúDog wtf my cybertruck just shut off on the freeway! üò°‚Äù he wrote in the caption. ‚ÄúAlmost just crashed wtf [@teslamotors](https://www.instagram.com/teslamotors/).‚Äù

[![screengrab of Instagram video of deactivated Tesla Cybertruck viral video](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-11-at-1.35.54%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C7.1992110453649%2C100%2C85.60157790927&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-11-at-1.35.54%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,7.1992110453649,100,85.60157790927)

Image: Screenshot / @bighuey313

The owner also [posted an image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNJuc0buCUl/) of what he claimed was a cease-and-desist letter from Tesla‚Äôs vice president of legal affairs, Dinna Eskin. The letter cites ‚Äúunauthorized use of Tesla‚Äôs intellectual property in musical content distributed under your name.‚Äù

The video quickly went viral on BlueSky, where anti-Elon Musk sentiment has helped fuel nationwide protests against Tesla. But users quickly noticed a number of discrepancies, such as the fact that the letter opens ‚ÄúWe represent Tesla‚Äù despite being signed by the company‚Äôs in-house counsel. The letter also uses Eskin‚Äôs old title, ‚ÄúSr. Director and Deputy General Counsel,‚Äù [despite her current title of VP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinna-eskin-743a7435/). And the warning message isn‚Äôt formatted like Tesla‚Äôs typical in-vehicle alerts and notifications. [An X user](https://x.com/jeremyjudkins_/status/1954892424825667602) speculated that the flashing red title was likely just a YouTube video playing on fullscreen to simulate a legitimate error.

Despite these issues, the video went viral on BlueSky, X, and Reddit ‚Äî and likely will continue to travel far and wide, confirming many people‚Äôs prior opinions about Tesla and Elon Musk.

_**Update August 11th:** [Tesla posted on X](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1954992987223757149?t=ySHgoE7tozr0eGDFHRrpaw&s=19) confirming the video is fake._
