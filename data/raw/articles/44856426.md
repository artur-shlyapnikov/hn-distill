your private messages and photos

## You Will Be Impacted

Every photo, every message, every file you send will be automatically scanned‚Äîwithout your consent or suspicion. This is not about catching criminals. It is mass surveillance imposed on all 450 million citizens of the European Union.

üì±

### Mass Surveillance

Every private message, photo, and file scanned automatically: no suspicion required, no exceptions\*, even encrypted communications.

üîìÔ∏è

### Breaking Encryption

Weakening or breaking end-to-end encryption exposes everyone‚Äôs communications‚Äîincluding sensitive financial, medical, and private data‚Äîto hackers, criminals, and hostile actors.

‚öñÔ∏è

### Fundamental Rights

Undermines your fundamental rights to privacy and data protection, as guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter‚Äîrights considered core to European democratic values.

üéØ

### False Positives

Automated scanners routinely misidentify innocent content, such as vacation photos or private jokes, as illegal, putting ordinary people at risk of false accusations and damaging investigations.

üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

### Ineffective Child Protection

Child protection experts and organisations, including the UN, warn that mass surveillance fails to prevent abuse and actually makes children less safe‚Äîby weakening security for everyone and diverting resources from proven protective measures.

üåç

### Global Precedent

Creates a dangerous global precedent enabling authoritarian governments, citing EU policy, to roll out intrusive surveillance at home, undermining privacy and free expression worldwide.

\*EU politicians exempt themselves from this surveillance under "professional secrecy" rules. They get privacy.  
You and your family do not. Demand fairness.

### What concerns you most about Chat Control?

#### Privacy Rights

Mandates indiscriminate, real-time scanning of all private digital communications, including encrypted chats.

#### Breaking Encryption

Requires backdoors in secure messaging, making everyone‚Äôs data vulnerable to hackers, spies, and abuse.

#### Ineffective Child Protection

Will flood investigators with erroneous reports, while real offenders migrate to hidden channels, leaving children no safer.

#### Undermining Democracy

Insufficient oversight sets a dangerous precedent for surveillance and discourages free speech.

#### Technical Issues

Unreliable AI and error-prone algorithms will falsely accuse innocent users, causing real legal and social harm.

#### Economic Impact

The law may push tech companies out of the EU, harming innovation and the digital economy.
