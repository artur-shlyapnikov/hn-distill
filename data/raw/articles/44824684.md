The Ardnamurchan Peninsula is known for its wild and unspoiled beauty and is a haven for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts. On this remote headland, golden eagles are a fairly common sight, as well as red deer, otters, and other rare animals. Amongst this stunning wilderness is a rich and thriving community. A tangible example of this is the community garden shop. It is an unmanned shed regularly stocked by local growers from the large garden behind it. There is usually a plethora of seasonal veg, sauces and even flowers.

Scottish seafood is a delicacy and mussels in particular benefit from the pristine waters around Scotland’s coasts.

These mussels are cultivated sustainably, benefiting from the nutrient-rich waters of the loch, which contribute to their wonderful flavour.

Shetland cake fridges are a bit of a cultural tradition found across the Shetland Islands. These unattended refrigerators, located in rural areas and outside homes or community spots, are stocked with a variety of home-baked goods such as cakes, scones, and biscuits. Customers are invited to take their chosen treats and leave the appropriate payment in a nearby box. This charming practice not only showcases the community’s trust and integrity but also provides a wonderful way to enjoy locally made delicacies.
