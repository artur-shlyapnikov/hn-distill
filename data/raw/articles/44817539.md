Title: Project Hyperion | interstellar generation ship design competition

URL Source: https://www.projecthyperion.org/

Markdown Content:
Design for Centuries

Project Hyperion explores the feasibility of crewed interstellar travel via generation ships, using current and near-future technologies. A generation ship is a hypothetical spacecraft designed for long-duration interstellar travel, where the journey may take centuries to complete. The idea behind a generation ship is that the initial crew would live, reproduce, and die on the ship, with their descendants continuing the journey until reaching the destination. These ships are often envisioned as self-sustaining ecosystems, featuring agriculture, habitation, and other necessary life-support systems to ensure survival across multiple generations.

​

The Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is) is delighted to reveal the winners of the Project Hyperion Design Competition, a landmark global challenge that called upon interdisciplinary teams to envision a generation ship—a crewed interstellar spacecraft designed for a 250-year journey to a habitable planet. The teams designed habitats of such a spacecraft that would allow a society to sustain itself and flourish in a highly resource-constrained environment.

​

The Project Hyperion Design Competition required architectural designers, engineers, and social scientists to collaborate and address critical mission aspects that enable a spacecraft to function as a closed society over centuries. The collaboration between different disciplines is key to finding holistic solutions that do justice to the complexity of the requirements, in order to provide:

*   Habitability for 1,000 ± 500 people over centuries

*   Artificial gravity via rotation

*   A society that ensures good living conditions, including essential provisions such as shelter, clothing, and other basic needs.

*   Robust life support systems for food, water, waste, and the atmosphere

*   Knowledge transfer mechanisms to retain culture and technologies

The design demonstrates thoughtful consideration of the time dimension and how the roles and needs of the population may evolve over the life of the habitat—an important and often underexplored aspect of long-term space settlement planning. The use of decoupled artificial gravity through counter-rotating rings is an excellent starting point, showing strong awareness of rotational dynamics and occupant comfort. While the rings are not concentric, which could potentially introduce unwanted torque due to offset centers of gravity, the concept still reflects a solid grasp of key mechanical challenges. The inclusion of maglev-supported habitat wagons enhances system redundancy and safety through multiple pressure vessels. The recognition that curved cylindrical modules would impose structural mass penalties, and the corresponding pivot to straight "sausage"-shaped modules with domed ends, shows a pragmatic engineering approach grounded in realistic structural constraints. Finally, the Mass/Equipment List (MEL) budgets represent a commendable early step in translating the conceptual architecture into quantifiable system requirements.

Galaxy Express 999 by EBS presents a well-considered approach to social organization, with a practical vision for internal modularity and adaptable living arrangements. The "Negotiopolis" concept is particularly compelling, offering an imaginative civic architecture and a negotiation-based governance model that introduces fresh perspectives on societal structure in an interstellar context. While the design is lighter on technical implementation, it contributes meaningfully to the broader discourse by emphasizing the importance of civic and social aspects. The artificial gravity concept is fundamentally sound, and the linear arrangement of pancake modules along the axis shows clear intent toward modular scalability. Although the pressure vessel design has some limitations—flat-ended cylindrical modules would face significant stress under pressure, requiring heavier structural reinforcement—there is awareness of this issue, as evidenced by partial attempts at incorporating domed ends. A refinement of this aspect, especially for end modules and during descent phases, would strengthen the structural logic. The internal modular system is sensibly developed and shows promise for flexible habitation. Inclusion of a Mass/Equipment List (MEL) would further support the design's technical depth, but the overall concept stands out for its imaginative and socially rich framework.

STASS presents a thoughtful and imaginative design supported by a well-articulated methodology and a solid structural overview. One of its most distinctive features is the inclusion of the Five-Point Knowledge Transmission System, which adds a meaningful cultural and educational dimension to the concept—ensuring continuity of knowledge and identity over generations. The design demonstrates good system-level coherence, with particular strengths in its approach to artificial gravity: a rotating toroidal volume paired with two counter-rotating flywheels, enabling efficient spin-up and spin-down using electrical energy rather than propellant. This is a technically sound and elegant solution that enhances long-term sustainability. While the elongated football-shaped geometry provides a striking visual identity. Radiation and impact protection strategies are addressed, including consideration of current TRLs, though the radiation shielding appears less robust compared to leading entries. The use of elliptical minor toroid cross-sections presents potential structural inefficiencies due to internal pressure forces that coulb e mitigated by the integration of residential spheres. Culturally, the concept leans into a somewhat mythical aesthetic. However, many of its themes—particularly those related to legacy and intergenerational knowledge—are highly relevant to interstellar missions. The interior designs contribute to an evocative and atmospheric presentation. The final layout is clean, visually engaging, and easy to navigate. Overall, STASS stands out for its narrative richness and coherent systems thinking, with room for further refinement in structural and radiation strategies.

Jury feedback
-------------

This submission offers an interesting and ambitious design, with modularity as a core concept—an approach that generally supports flexibility and resilience. It stands out as one of the most integrated proposals seen so far, demonstrating strength across architecture, engineering, and social systems, and embodying the spirit of envisioning a generation ship that balances speculative vision with system-level coherence. The DNA-shaped vessel and the arrangement of globular habitats linked in a spiral pattern are visually and conceptually intriguing. The pressure vessel design is solid, and the artificial gravity approach appears generally sound, though some visual elements—such as people walking on the zero-g core cylinder walls—may overstate the effective gravity in those areas. The abundance of AI-generated images contributes to a striking but somewhat disjointed presentation; many visuals lack clear correspondence to detailed drawings. The mission control center design also feels somewhat unconventional, with its wide floor facing a circular windshield, which may merit further reconsideration. Overall, the submission impresses with its ambitious scope and integration. It may benefit from clearer technical documentation and tighter alignment between visuals and engineering details.
