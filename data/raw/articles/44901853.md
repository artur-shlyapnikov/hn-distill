# What is OWhisper?

> `OWhisper` can be thought of as something like `Ollama` but for **Speech-to-Text**(both **real-time** and **batch**).

This came from our experience while building [Hyprnote](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote), where users consistently requested bringing a **custom STT endpoint**, just like plugging in an openai-compatible LLM endpoint. `OWhisper` is intended for 2 use cases:

1.  Quickly serving a lightweight model locally **for prototyping or personal use**.
2.  Deploying larger models or connecting to other cloud-hosted models on **your own infrastructure**.
