# Apple Working on All-New Operating System

Saturday August 16, 2025 6:45 am PDT by [Joe Rossignol](https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/)

Apple is developing an all-new operating system codenamed "Charismatic," according [to _Bloomberg_'s Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-13/apple-s-ai-turnaround-plan-robots-lifelike-siri-and-home-security-cameras).

![Home Hub Command Center with Dome Base Feature](https://images.macrumors.com/t/yF4iVd55558C-ijRX_rE0B3rcXs=/400x0/article-new/2025/08/Home-Hub-Command-Center-with-Dome-Base-Feature.jpg?lossy)  
This is likely Apple's [long-rumored "homeOS" operating system](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/homeos-trademark-filings/).

In a report this week, Gurman said both Apple's rumored [smart home hub in 2026](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-smart-home-hub-2026/) and [tabletop robot in 2027](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/) will run the new operating system. He said the software platform will blend elements of tvOS and watchOS. For example, he expects there to be a hexagonal grid of apps, just like on the Apple Watch.

The platform largely revolves around clock faces and widgets, and it will have multi-user support, Gurman said. Users will primarily interact with it using Siri voice commands, but touch will also be an option, he said. Some of the preinstalled apps from Apple will apparently include Calendar, Camera, Music, Reminders, and Notes.

Here is what he said about multi-user support:

> The devices are meant to be easily shared: They include a front-facing camera that can scan users' faces as they walk toward it and then automatically change the layout, features and content to the preferences of that person.

We should learn more about the new operating system over the coming months.

Monday August 11, 2025 12:09 pm PDT by [Juli Clover](https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/)

Apple is continuing to tweak the way that the Liquid Glass design looks ahead of the iOS 26 launch, and the latest beta makes a change to the Lock Screen. The Lock Screen clock has been updated with additional transparency, allowing more of the background to peek through. Beta 6 on left, beta 5 on right The clock also has more of a 3D, floating look, which is in line with the rest of the ...

Somebody at MacRumors is having a bad day. This is the second attempt at posting this I've seen. Unless I have developed psychic powers.  
  
Anyway, my thoughts are that this isn't a new operating system. It's a new UI. It'll all still be based on Apple's Darwin/mach kernel (ah, how we used to talk endlessly about that in the olds days). I'm sure Apple will do a great job, though. That's what they do.

The hexagon grid of apps on the Watch was always a bad idea. Please do not repeat it here.

It's time for one Apple OS. Same architecture, unified UI. They're really spreading themselves too thin. Yes, they already kind of have the same base, but you can see with visionOS how far behind that is with missing features, etc. We're closer to 10 operating systems than 1 at this point.

Apple will want it to stand out as "different" for marketing and customer communication purposes. Yeah, sure, the UX may suffer, but hey, it's new! ?

You want the Apple Watch to run the same OS as an Apple TV? How's that going to work?
