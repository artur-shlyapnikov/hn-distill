The US$600 million agreement for the Saab JAS 39 Gripens was first announced in June as part of a long-term plan to modernise the air force’s combat capabilities.

During five days of clashes with [Cambodia](https://www.scmp.com/topics/cambodia?module=inline&pgtype=article) that left more than 40 people dead, Thailand used its fleet of F-16s to strike military targets across the border.

It was the deadliest border fighting between the two countries in decades.
