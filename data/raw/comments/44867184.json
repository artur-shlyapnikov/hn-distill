    "textPlain": "TheÂ GUI looks useful but for the core problem:> Managing multiple Linux servers usually means juggling terminal windows and copy-pasting snippets/scripts. [...]There is already a plethora of tooling for many of these points. Not a lot of GUI stuff but ansible seems to cover a lot of ground (inventory, organized playbooks instead of shell scripts). Ansible also \"just\" uses SSH as a transplrt mechanism.This feels like a solution that tries to support a flawed workflow instead a solution improving the workflow itself.",
