The answer is probably somewhere between 5 and 7 years. Then find salary statistics, and see how much the average salary has increased in the same time. The answer is probably somewhere between 20 and 30%.And it really is as simple as that. As society we have tremendously increased productivity, and most of it is taken/given to the owner of the capital, not the provider of labour.",

Worried about it, I went to Urgent care and got billed $3400 (dollars) for antibiotics, WHICH WERE WRONG, an actual ophthalmologist said I had it scratched and just had to apply some drops. $250 for the ophthalmologist and about $50 for the drops.This week I am in Brazil for vacation, and my mother-in-law had a lot of back pain. We went to a private \"urgent care\" (or equivalent here), and it was R$ 200 for the visit, R$ 300 for the X-rays, and R$ 80 for the medicine. That's about $100 dollars. And the only reason why we went to private is because the public hospital wait was about 3 hours, otherwise it would have been free (yeah I know taxes).And I have good health insurance in the US, but navigating co-pays vs. deductibles vs. in network vs. this particular person isn't on network (like the anesthetist for my wife's C-Section which we only learned about when we were already there at the hospital for the surgery) and just overall everything is so freaking expensive... The system is broken, and no amount of startup trying to shave off 5% of some random administrative cost using AI will save it.",

There is a thing called 'the outside'.Look at the cars many of the people who complain about being squeezed are driving. Pickups for the sake of driving one. Lower/mid end BMW/Lexus/Mercedes. Giant SUVs when a smaller one will more than do. There are actually still relatively low priced vehicles available but they are plain jane and looked down upon.I mention those things as I was head of an HOA for about 10 years and we regularly had owners who were in arrears or in and out of arrears. They would come before the board asking for waivers of late fees, interest and even the basic common charge. Yet they were aghast when the board suggested they drop their cable TV or swapped their expensive car lease for a beater. And heaven forbid you suggest they stop going to Starbucks as they sit in front of you asking forgiveness with a large latte in hand.",

And that's expected. Not exactly super-cool, but we don't want there to be no inflation at all. It should be moderate, 1-2% is an awesome amount. But it's quite beyond a lot of people’s speaking.The problem is that not a single person has told Joe Smith from the 5th Ave that he should be demanding a 7% raise this year. Why? Well, his boss has just produced 7% more due to inflation. Joe was working hard and he should have deserved something.Instead of teaching Joe to be responsible for his income by asking raises we don't talk to Joe about it. He is not proactive in his business so he could ask for said raises. We explain poor Joe that he is totally at the disposal of some \"Banks\" or \"Corporations\" and stuff like that. We tell Joe that the only thing he could potentially do about the entire situation is to go to Walmart and clip a coupon, because they do have discounts.A simple example: Let's look at the lumber prices [1] in around 1975. Not a best year to buy lumber. It was $150.Now, let's plug this value into an inflation calculator. [2] $150 in 1975 is $900 today.Let's look at the price of lumber in 2025 [1]. Currently the price of lumber is around $600.That's good. It looks like the lumber has become cheaper. One would expect with 500% inflation since 1975 the lumber to cost $900, but it's only $600. So our Joe Smith is happy!Yet he is not. He is not that concerned about the lumber. Yet in 2025 he looks at the price of an iPhone or a new computer or a car. Or a house. And he knows that he can't afford said house.The issue is that in the past 30 years, Joe Smith has been content to get a 5-10% bonus at the end of the",
