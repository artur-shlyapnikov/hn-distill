It's so sad that I spent thousands on multiple Mac devices (MBP, M Studio, etc.) only to be bottlenecked not by hardware, but by Apple's shitty approach to gaming software.I know why they do it though. Apple can't take their undeserved 30% cut of Mac games the same way they take their iOS cuts.We had a teacher years ago who said something that remains true until today: \"everything is about money, especially the ones that appear to have non-monetary reasons.\"",

    "textPlain": "Oh it’s not just Apple…This was an issue I also discovered on Xbox 360 in 2008. TV’s have overscan and depending on that setting, your resolutions will be off.However, at the time, we couldn’t create render targets that matched the overscan safe area. XNA added a Screen SafeArea rect to help guide people but it was still an issue that you had to consciously develop for.Now, we can create any back buffer size we want. It’s best to create one 1:1 or use DLSS with a target of 1:1 to the safe area for best results. I’m glad the author went and reported it but ultimately it’s up to developers to know Screen Resolution != Render Resolution.Anyone using wgpu/vulkan/AppKit/SDL/glfw/etc need to know this.",

Not great. Technically there's a 683:384 ratio in there.[1]But it did enough of the job that users who knew what resolution they wanted to pick in the first place didn't have to scroll a gargantuan list![1]: https://github.com/Planimeter/game-engine-2d/blob/v9.0.1/eng...",
