It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community. It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return.\n— Henry George, Progress and Poverty, Book VIII, Chapter 3Very relevant to this particular article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#/media/File:Everybody...>\"EVERYBODY WORKS BUT THE VACANT LOT\" I paid $3600, for this lot and will hold till I get $6000. The profit is unearned increment made possible by the presence of this community and enterprise of its people. I take the profit without earning it. For the remedy read \"HENRY GEORGE\"",

But you absolutely can screw it up more.Now, in a low regulation environment you probably could just up the taxes and let owners make do.  A bunch of random low end income earning crap (storage lots or whatever, heavy on the whatever) will pop up to pay the tax bill.  But Baltimore is not that so you'll probably just get the city owning a bunch of that vacant property instead which is a lateral or a step backward due to increased friction of development.Tangentially, the author forgets that the reason cities like Baltimore adopted such policy was to encourage the bulldozing of uninhabitable structures lest they become less than legally inhabited. I get that a certain type of people love to screech about tax intake being an unalloyed good here but what's really happening is that the city is amortizing the cost of bulldozing crack dens over time via tax incentive for owners of \"teardown\" quality structures to take that step (which up's adjacent property values).",

    "textPlain": "Land Value Tax (one of the main theories pushed by Georgism proponents) is a favorite of online discussion forums, but becomes progressively less popular as the conversation turns from broad strokes to details.Every time it comes up it seems many people are also unaware that taxing land value is already common practice. It’s common to have one tax for the assessed value of the land and another tax for the assessed value of the improvements. Policies might include exemptions for the first so many dollars of a person’s primary residence structure.With a pure Land Value Tax you cover your eyes and pretend the value of the structures and improvements doesn’t count. If one wealthy neighbor builds a $2,000,000 house next to a retired grandma living out her final years in her small, old forever home, the LVT people don’t care. If their lots are the same then they must pay the same taxes because the land value is what matters.This makes it a very regressive tax structure as the people or businesses with the least valuable structures now subdivide their neighbors with the most valuable structures. This can all be avoided by simply using our existing system of having a tax on land and a tax on structures each at their assessed value.",

The thing is that elected officials control the tax rate, not SDAT. SDAT only values the properties.Rising property values don't have to mean rising taxes, the elected officials can lower the tax rate in response -- this what the term \"no new revenue rate\" is for.It's also not just about pushing tax burden onto vacant lots. When property A is undervalued relative to property B, property B picks up more of the property taxes. So if a lot of vacant land is undervalued, that means a lot of improved land is paying more taxes proportionately. It seems sub-optimal that property where nobody lives is given a tax subsidy and the difference is realized in rising taxes for everyone else.The main point is that the law requires that everyone be valued at market rate. That should be done first. Then any special case exemptions, write-downs, discounts, and the tax rate itself, should be handled at the political layer, where they are explicit and conscious rather than implicit.We can debate what the relative impact of this is in the big picture, but this seems like something that is worth fixing.",

It’s currently other people’s money and mostly even future people’s money, squandered without any meaningful limits, barriers, or even rules regarding conflicts of interests; and there are virtually zero actual and real, immediate consequences for malfeasance by people charged with the duty of responsible allocation of funds. It’s a corrupt and rotten system from the very top to the very bottom.Unfortunately not enough people care, understand, or might even like it because they benefit from it and think they will die before the music stops.
