    "textPlain": "Nice work. I like the simple, unobtrusive and ad-free interface. I have kids who could use this although you face lots of competition for their very limited allotted active screen time [1]. The 6 yo gets 45 mins a week on the computer, usually opting for PBSkids, Kodable or Scratch. The 3 yo gets 15 mins usually opting for guided digital canvas painting as she learns to use a mouse.There are a few good no-screen puzzle books for kids (lookup the ones by Usborne).As a recent publisher of an interactive children's book [2], I am seeing more sales of the physical books than the digital/web editions despite the latter having more features including an element of teaching math.Curious if you considered publishing a physical book with these concepts/math puzzles?[1] This app inspires me to upgrade some of their passive screen time (TV) to more of your and similar apps[2] https://tendollaradventure.com",

However, if you always guess in the middle of the upper and lower bound, then you eliminate 50% of the possibilities. It's a pretty neat trick to get kids to think about how to approach a problem that seems random in a structured way.",

    "textPlain": "the 2nd game, click the prime numbers, my second board had only a 1 as a potential candidate, and 1 is not considered prime. the other numbers were all composites and I was awarded a big fat zero for knowing all this. (I went back in and the game does not allow clicking the 1, good; but the description \"divisible only by 1 and themselves\" doesn't really rule it out. maybe don't give 1's or explain this)clicking the prime numbers is a bit hard to do, and they scooch out of the viewing area and disappear for a bit. not complaining but while i was figuring out the game on my first board, I did terribly because of that.given the level of math proficiency required for the prime number game, I was shocked in the next math grid game when using the ascend/descend buttons it simply told me every time I had hit the right answer. thought this was how to play so I didn't try typing numbers in. on my firefox browswer the answer numbers are too big to fit in the cells.",
