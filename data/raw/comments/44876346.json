    "textPlain": "I think ML has lots of potential in this area specifically.Imagine a game with bare-bones graphics and lighting, and a NN that converts it into something pretty. Indie developers can make AA-looking games and all game developers can devote more effort into design and logic. Artists will still be needed for art direction and possibly fine-tuning, although there will be less needed for each game (also less developers needed with AI agents and better tools).Related, ML also has potential for AI enemies (and allies). Lots of players still prefer multiplayer, in part because humans are more realistic enemies (but also because they want to beat real humans); but multiplayer games struggle because good netcode is nontrivial, servers are expensive, some players are obnoxious, and most games don’t have a consistent enough playerbase.",

I'm a bit skeptical because this is a press release for chips that are in the works and claim to be releasing in DEC-26, and then on actual devices after that. So sounds more like a strategic/political move (Perhaps stock price related manoeuvring).Unreal Engine 5 plugin will allow previewing the upscaled effects using the though, which will be nice for game developers.",
