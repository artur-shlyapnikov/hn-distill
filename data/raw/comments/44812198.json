The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details.",

    "textPlain": "I'm modestly surprised to learn Google was using Salesforce internally at all; the NIH runs deep with that company (they even have their own bugtracker because every other option just wouldn't cut it).On the other hand, the past decade-ish has seen them grow very rapidly via acquisition, so perhaps this DB was grandfathered in via an acquired company and hadn't yet been replaced by anything internal.(For Salesforce in particular though, I'd be willing to believe Google doesn't have an in-house alternative... People asked for a Salesforce-like in Google Workspace for years and the company had no interest. I have a hunch that most Googlers find the idea of creating a new CRM to be a profoundly boring intellectual exercise).",
