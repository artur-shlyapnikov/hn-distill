    "textPlain": "I relate to so much of this. So much. First: the job which involves mostly burning code - so satisfying, I wouldn't call that my dream job, but that element of the job is one of the most rewarding for me - when it's my code, anyway! A nonsignificant part of my job now is deleting code my business partner has written with Cursor - so far we are mostly happy with this, it takes less time for him to write the code and for me to delete it than it does for me to write the code. But we are a tiny team with no front-end devs. Which brings me to the second thing: \"The LLMs don't learn.\" My god! Sometimes I just want to take Cursor by the lapels and shake it. \"Read the .cursorrules! They are rules for Cursor! You are Cursor! They are rules for you!\" So much of what Cursor does that shits me to tears is stuff where, if it were an actual junior dev, I'd sit them down and walk through it with them - precisely the process that evolves them to Gyarados, like you say. That lack of meaningful development on the machine's behalf is so frustrating and really kind of alienating - you do meet devs like that, the ones that stubbornly refuse to learn and do better, and they are some of the worst people in the world.",
