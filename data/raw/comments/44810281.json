Using Ventoy is a huge risk regardless of what you think of maintainer credibility at this point.The cynical take is that what's on display in this issue is feigned ignorance/incompetence constructing plausible deniability.Their security posture has not evolved with the times, the threat-landscape, and the growth of the project.[0]: Very doubtful if you have been following this saga or dig around enough",
