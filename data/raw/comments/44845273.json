Maybe the Californian fast food sector is just having a tough time for unrelated and coincidental reasons.However, the theory always said that a minimum wage rise reduces the number of jobs so it is a strong chance that around 20,000 people were put out of work by this policy.",

People with less fitness for employment may be more likely to be harmed.That’s a big success for the former group for sure. Whether that’s a policy success is slightly hazier than you presented I think, without other interventions to support those who are more likely to be harmed by the reduction in employment.",

    "textPlain": "It's too soon to say.  Increasing the cost of labor will reduce jobs in the short term, and increase the cost of fast food.  In the medium term, that may lead to people cutting back on fast food, which then leads to more job loss.If fast food companies have perfect knowledge of their market, then the immediate job loss would be all that happens, but they don't so it will take some time to adapt to the new market, and see if consumers will bear the increase in cost.That's not even considering substitutes for labor, which have never been as competitive as they are now.  AI, robotics, single-purpose machines, etc.  One negative to a minimum wage is that we don't actually know the market price of labor.  When there is a shift from humans to machines for labor, it will happen quickly and without warning, rather than slowly as humans become dissatisfied with decreasing wages.",
