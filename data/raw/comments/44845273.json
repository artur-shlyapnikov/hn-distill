    "textPlain": "FRED (the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), has useful data.First, all food/beverage hospitality workers in California.[1] Huge COVID transient, followed by recovery to almost the pre-COVID level. But no further increases.Full-service restaurants had a similar transient, but never came back to pre-COVID levels. Employment peaked in mid-2023, and has declined since. Full-service restaurants didn't get the $20 fast food minimum wage. But workers there may have tip income. \nCalifornia does not have a lower \"tipped minimum wage\", and all tips go to workers.What FRED calls \"limited service restaurants and other eating places\" shows about the same curve as full-service restaurants.[3] This includes both the fast food chains and the fast-casual restaurants. If you have to order at a counter, it's \"limited service\", even if they bring out the food later.So, the part of the restaurant industry that wasn't affected by the increase shows about the same trend as the part that was. Basically, post-COVID, onsite eating never fully came back. Food delivery became a much bigger part of the industry.)Those stats are regardless of business size. California's minimum wage law for \"fast food\" applies only to businesses with at least 60 locations. But it also includes such\nthings as 7-11 stores that sell hot dogs and pizzas heated up on site. So, not an exact match to the FRED categories.Overall, the COVID transient and its aftermath is bigger than all other visible effects.[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU06000007072200001SA[2] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU06000007072251101A[3] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU06000007072259001SA",

    "textPlain": "As someone who kinda followed this debate for a while, I will point out that there is actually a large split down the middle of the on whether minimum wage increases decrease employment. And that split isn't actually due to ideological bias (which is the usual accusation), but rather methodology: almost all of the studies which confirm employment reductions use one methodology, and almost all of the studies which do not confirm employment loss use another methodology, and there is a large debate in econometrics as to how reasonable the assumptions are for each of the two methodologies.One thing that always seems to be at a disconnect between the economic literature and policy makers is the economic context of the raise in wages. Even those economists that have bought in fully that minimum wage increases don't typically decrease employment will have several caveats to that statement, usually worded in the form of \"small increases in the minimum wage\". That is to say that there are often small inefficiencies in our current markets which allow employers to reduce wages in cartel-like fashion, and small increases in the minimum wage can claw some of that back in favor of the employees at the expense of employers' economic rents, but not at the expense of economic output. But large increases in the minimum wage absolutely can jump the shark, decreasing economic output by effectively making low margin sectors untenable entirely. If that weren't the case, we would be able to raise it infinitely without any negative effects, which is absolutely absurd (and unfortunately that is the takeaway that ideologues often get from reading abstracts).A more useful economic model would go a step further than just saying \"you can raise the minimum wage without harm to the economy\", by incorporating econometric analysis which can accurately predict when and how much you can raise it without incurring economic harm.",

The people could grow their skills and contribute more to society, a society where low end business constantly complain about how hard it is to find skilled workers.High minimum wage contributes to more people on social safety nets living on low fixed incomes because the gulf between that and paid employment becomes too great and there is no low wage on ramp for them.",

    "textPlain": "It depends upon how you define \"success.\"  I visit California regularly, and since the new minimum wage law went into effect, I've noticed reduced hours, reduced staff, and increased prices.  So now my normal breakfast spot isn't open when I want to go there, so I eat at home.  The places I visit when they are open are mostly empty, because the customers don't want to wait longer and/or pay higher prices.So aside from the fewer employees getting a raise, the businesses are now under financial stress because of the reduced revenue, the customers have fewer options for where to eat, and the State of California and the local city/county governments will receive less tax revenue from these restaurants.Like most of the other recent California legislation, it's a \"success\" at further damaging the local economy and encouraging people like myself to stay away.",

People with less fitness for employment may be more likely to be harmed.That’s a big success for the former group for sure. Whether that’s a policy success is slightly hazier than you presented I think, without other interventions to support those who are more likely to be harmed by the reduction in employment.",

    "textPlain": "It's too soon to say.  Increasing the cost of labor will reduce jobs in the short term, and increase the cost of fast food.  In the medium term, that may lead to people cutting back on fast food, which then leads to more job loss.If fast food companies have perfect knowledge of their market, then the immediate job loss would be all that happens, but they don't so it will take some time to adapt to the new market, and see if consumers will bear the increase in cost.That's not even considering substitutes for labor, which have never been as competitive as they are now.  AI, robotics, single-purpose machines, etc.  One negative to a minimum wage is that we don't actually know the market price of labor.  When there is a shift from humans to machines for labor, it will happen quickly and without warning, rather than slowly as humans become dissatisfied with decreasing wages.",
