One group heavily cut out would be those without work experience such as kids and other first entering the marketplace.Fast food is a stepping stone job, and if employeers have to pay more for labor then they will be pickier about it.Let's think about the reverse. If we cut minimum wage, the sector would be much more loose about hiring first time workers, convicts, or people just not fit for other jobs. The people could grow their skills and contribute more to society, a society where low end business constantly complain about how hard it is to find skilled workers.High minimum wage contributes to more people on social safety nets living on low fixed incomes because the gulf between that and paid employment becomes too great and there is no low wage on ramp for them.",

The places I visit when they are open are mostly empty, because the customers don't want to wait longer and/or pay higher prices.So aside from the fewer employees getting a raise, the businesses are now under financial stress because of the reduced revenue, the customers have fewer options for where to eat, and the State of California and the local city/county governments will receive less tax revenue from these restaurants.Like most of the other recent California legislation, it's a \"success\" at further damaging the local economy and encouraging people like myself to stay away.",

In the medium term, that may lead to people cutting back on fast food, which then leads to more job loss.If fast food companies have perfect knowledge of their market, then the immediate job loss would be all that happens, but they don't so it will take some time to adapt to the new market, and see if consumers will bear the increase in cost.That's not even considering substitutes for labor, which have never been as competitive as they are now.  AI, robotics, single-purpose machines, etc.  One negative to a minimum wage is that we don't actually know the market price of labor.  When there is a shift from humans to machines for labor, it will happen quickly and without warning, rather than slowly as humans become dissatisfied with decreasing wages.",

If a business is able to increase productivity, they will pay more and fire staff. If they won't then they shut down. And the side-effect, which cannot be measured by economists so doesn't exist, is that some will evade the limit. The theory isn't that minimum wage reduces jobs, it depends in every case...but the best that can be said is that it has no impact.Card and Kruger, for example, was/is presented as some kind of massive revolution. It is completely useless. Studies concentrate on fast food because it is one of the only sectors that has managed to increase productivity, the wider consequences are ignored. The only reason this industry for DiD minimum-wage papers exist is to give policymakers a button to push when their popularity is collapsing. The idea of the government dictating minimum labour productivity makes no sense (in the US, the policy mix also makes no sense because you have uncontrolled labour supply but the government sets minimum labour productivity...why? It is heaviest incentive for breaking the laws that you set, minimum productivity is set with the knowledge that it won't apply to many people).",
