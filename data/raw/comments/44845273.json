    "textPlain": "FRED (the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), has useful data.First, all food/beverage hospitality workers in California.[1] Huge COVID transient, followed by recovery to almost the pre-COVID level. But no further increases.Full-service restaurants had a similar transient, but never came back to pre-COVID levels. Employment peaked in mid-2023, and has declined since. Full-service restaurants didn't get the $20 fast food minimum wage. But workers there may have tip income. \nCalifornia does not have a lower \"tipped minimum wage\", and all tips go to workers.What FRED calls \"limited service restaurants and other eating places\" shows about the same curve as full-service restaurants.[3] This includes both the fast food chains and the fast-casual restaurants. If you have to order at a counter, it's \"limited service\", even if they bring out the food later.So, the part of the restaurant industry that wasn't affected by the increase shows about the same trend as the part that was. Basically, post-COVID, onsite eating never fully came back. Food delivery became a much bigger part of the industry.)Those stats are regardless of business size. California's minimum wage law for \"fast food\" applies only to businesses with at least 60 locations. But it also includes such\nthings as 7-11 stores that sell hot dogs and pizzas heated up on site. So, not an exact match to the FRED categories.Overall, the COVID transient and its aftermath is bigger than all other visible effects.[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU06000007072200001SA[2] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU06000007072251101A[3] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU06000007072259001SA",

Fewer employees are needed when there's no dining area to clean or counter to staff. I’m pretty sure this is the direction things are headed in California.",

If we cut minimum wage, the sector would be much more loose about hiring first time workers, convicts, or people just not fit for other jobs. The people could grow their skills and contribute more to society, a society where low end business constantly complain about how hard it is to find skilled workers.High minimum wage contributes to more people on social safety nets living on low fixed incomes because the gulf between that and paid employment becomes too great and there is no low wage on ramp for them.",

They of course asked us to park and after 15 minutes I went inside and asked what was going on. they apologized and said they were out of chicken as they got a rush when I ordered and it takes 7 minutes to cook.\nThere were a grand total of 4 employees in the store sitting at a busy intersection with a double drive through line and an indoor eating area. Just utter lack of management and employees and customers pay the price.its 10 minutes before breakfast ends, I'm pretty confident the same rush happens every day at that time.
