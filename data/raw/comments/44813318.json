    "textPlain": "Hey all, today the Azure Core Upstream team has open sourced Wassette: a WebAssembly-based runtime that allows Wasm Components to connect to AI agents using the Model Context Protocol. Wassette’s main contribution to the MCP space is efficient sandboxing: because if you’re going to run untrusted third-party tools locally, it’s probably a good idea to proactively restrict which system resources it can access.In this post we explain what Wassette is, how to set it up locally, and finally walk through an example that exercises Wassette’s capability system. What we don’t cover in the post is how to write Wasm Component-based tooling for Wassette, but we have some docs for that in the README [1].Anyway, I hope this interesting to folks here! I’ll be around for a couple of hours here to answer questions folk might have. And if I don’t know the answer, I can probably find an engineer who does. Thanks![1]: https://github.com/microsoft/wassette#building-for-wassette",
