    "textPlain": "With the latest Microsoft Word, if you open a PDF that is a scanned image of a document and convert it to Word format, it does a pretty decent job of not only OCR (optical character recognition) but also picking matching fonts for various sections.I just tested this with my internet connection disabled and it still worked. Since it's doing local processing, I suspect it uses traditional OCR algorithms rather than LLMs.As the article concludes, LLMs aren't magic, they're just one useful tool to include in your toolbox.",

It turned out to be Ubuntu Mono. It was surprising that so many obscure fonts were suggested, none of which were even a reasonably close match, while Ubuntu Mono was completely overlooked.",
