    "textPlain": "This is interesting, it really sounds like they were running a pretty normal salvage operation with the evil twist of \"they were selling the salvaged drives as new\" -- kinda feels like dialing back the odometer on a car.Barring that \"evil twist\", they'd not be doing anything all that uncommon/illegal but refurbished hard drives and the companies that sell them have been a bit scammy/\"buyer beware\" hardware for as long as I can remember.Back in the early 90s, I spent a year saving up for and building the best 486 PC I could buy.  I went with a 330MB[0] SCSI drive that I picked up from a small magazine advertisement in Computer Shopper.  They advertised it as refurbished, and there was no such thing as SMART parameters to reset (were there even counters of any kind back then, I can't remember?) so there was no way to tell how long it had been used except for the price.  These were more than half off.It seemed shady, the price was still several hundred dollars (though, I want to say something like $500 off of the cheapest new option) and being a dumb teenager, I called the number and placed the order.My heart sunk a bit when it arrived.  If memory serves, this was the one that came with all but one of the threaded screw slots completely stripped (of the four I needed to use given my case).  Technically, they were all stripped, but one of them still had the screw -- left behind, evidently, because it became welded to the hole.After some delicate work with a metal file, I got it all installed and nothing worked.  So I called the manufacturer who took about ten seconds to find the problem: That's a Differential SCSI drive.  It took another few minutes for him to explain what that meant.  There was no mention of this in the advertisement (they didn't even include the model number, just \"330GB SCSI DRIVES!\"  I think these were common in AS/400s or something along those lines.fsck.So ... I bought a differential SCSI controller, cable and terminator, which set me back more th",

Following the cryptocurrency's downfall, numerous miners sold these used drives to workshops where many were illicitly repurposed to appear new. This bust may represent only the tip of the iceberg, as Heise estimates that at least one million of these Chia drives are circulating, although the exact number that have been recycled remains uncertain.Chia? That was early Covid. I'm surprised that it took so long for the poor abused drives to re-enter the supply chains.And for the record: fuck cryptocurrencies. All of them.
