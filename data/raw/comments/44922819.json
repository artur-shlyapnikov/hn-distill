    "textPlain": "> Seagate suspects that the used hard drives originated from China during the Chia boom. Following the cryptocurrency's downfall, numerous miners sold these used drives to workshops where many were illicitly repurposed to appear new. This bust may represent only the tip of the iceberg, as Heise estimates that at least one million of these Chia drives are circulating, although the exact number that have been recycled remains uncertain.Chia? That was early Covid. I'm surprised that it took so long for the poor abused drives to re-enter the supply chains.And for the record: fuck cryptocurrencies. All of them. So much wasted hardware, all for nothing in the end.",

It was supposed to be the \"green\" crypto, because crypto is in a bad enough state that \"buying exabytes of hard drives\" is considered the green approach.I guess some people managed to make money in the very early days, but it's been a long time since it's made any sense as a profit-maker. Right now, 200TB earns you just under 26 USD/month. Who are these people that can afford 200TB of storage but need money so bad that $26/month is exciting?",
