    "textPlain": "I recently discovered that ollama no longer uses llama.cpp as a library, and instead they link to the low level library (ggml) which requires them to reinvent a lot of wheel for absolutely no benefit (if there's some benefit I'm missing, please let me know).Even using llama.cpp as a library seems like an overkill for most use cases. Ollama could make its life much easier by spawning llama-server as a subprocess listening on a unix socket, and forward requests to it.One thing I'm curious about: Does ollama support strict structured output or strict tool calls adhering to a json schema? Because it would be insane to rely on a server for agentic use unless your server can guarantee the model will only produce valid json. AFAIK this feature is implemented by llama.cpp, which they no longer use.",

    "textPlain": "I got to speak with some of the leads at Ollama and asked more or less this same question. The reason they abandoned llama.cpp is because it does not align with their goals.llama.cpp is designed to rapidly adopt research-level optimisations and features, but the downside is that reported speeds change all the time (sometimes faster, sometimes slower) and things break really often. You can't hope to establish contracts with simultaneous releases if there is no guarantee the model will even function.By reimplementing this layer, Ollama gets to enjoy a kind of LTS status that their partners rely on. It won't be as feature-rich, and definitely won't be as fast, but that's not their goal.",

Best you can do is wrap the call in a (non-llm) json schema validator, and emit an error json in case the llm output does not match the schema, which is what some APIs do for you, but not very complicated to do yourself.Someone correct me if I'm wrong",
