It's astounding how much work and time goes into making a product that, although it's of course produced \"on mass\", feels anything other than mass produced.",

And that has become actually, and this is another novelty, very politicised in recent years. The current government, which of all the various right wing parties have been in power since 1994, is the one that most is most proud of its sort of fascist DNA, if I feel like, it's linked to historical links to Mussolini's fascist Party.
