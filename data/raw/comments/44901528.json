    "textPlain": "Looks great to automate workload for Windows desktop application. I'd love to understand more deeply how your application works, so the set of commands your backend send is click, scroll, screenshot. Does it send command to say type character into an input field? How is it able to pin point a text field from a screenshot? Is LLM reliable to pin point x and y to click on a field?Also, to have this run in a large scale, Does it become prohibitively expensive to run on daily basis on thousand of custom workflows? I assume this runs on the cloud.",
