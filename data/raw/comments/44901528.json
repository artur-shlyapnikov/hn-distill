    "textPlain": "Congrats! I think the space is very interesting, I was a founder of a similar windows CUA infra/ RPA agents but pivoted. My thoughts:1) The funny thing about determinism is how deterministic you should be when to break, its kind of a recursive problem. agents are inherently very tough to guardrail on an action space so big like in CUA. The guys from browser use realized it as well and built workflow-use. Or you could try RL or finetuning per task but is not viable(economically or tech wise) currently.2) As you know, It's a very client facing/customized solution space  You might find this interesting, it reflects my thoughts in the space as well. Tough to scale as a fresh startup unless you really niche down on some specific workflows. https://x.com/erikdunteman/status/1923140514549043413 (he is also building in the deterministic agent space now funnily enough)  \n3) It actually is annoyingly expensive with Claude if you break caching, which you have to at some point if you feed in every screenshot etc. You mentioned you use multiple models (i guess uitars/omniparser?), but in the comments you said claude?4) Ultimately the big bet in the RPA space, as again you know, is that the TAM wont shrink a lot due to more and more SAP's, ERP's etc implementing API's. Of course the big money will always be in ancient apps that wont, but then again in that space, uipath and the others have a chokehold. (and their agentic tech is actually surprisingly good when i had a look 3 months ago)Good luck in any case! I feel like its one of those spaces that we are definitely still a touch too early, but its such a big market that there is plenty of space for a lot of people.",

    "textPlain": "Looks great to automate workload for Windows desktop application. I'd love to understand more deeply how your application works, so the set of commands your backend send is click, scroll, screenshot. Does it send command to say type character into an input field? How is it able to pin point a text field from a screenshot? Is LLM reliable to pin point x and y to click on a field?Also, to have this run in a large scale, Does it become prohibitively expensive to run on daily basis on thousand of custom workflows? I assume this runs on the cloud.",

    "textPlain": "Thanks! And yes, so our pathfinder agents utilize Sonnet 4's precise coordinate generation capabilities. You give it a screenshot, give it a task, and it can output exact coordinates of where to click on an input field, for example.And yes we've found the computer use models are quite reliable.Great questions on scale: the whole way we designed our engine is that in the happy path, we actually use very little LLMs. The agent runs deterministically, only checking at various critical spots if anomalies occurred (if it does, we fallback to computer use to take it home). If not, our system can complete an entire task end to end, on the order of less than $0.0001.So it's a hybrid system at the end of the day. This results in really low costs at scale, as well as speed and reliability improvements (since in the happy path, we run exactly what has worked before).",

You end up having to repair all of them all the time, in fact there's a whole consulting industry out there just to do this all day.The whole idea of Cyberdesk is the prompt is the source of truth, and then once you learn a task once via CUA, the system follows that cache most of the time until you have to fall back to CUA, which follows the prompt. And that anomaly is also cached too.So over time, the system just learns, and gets cheaper and faster.",
