    "textPlain": "This project simulates a UR5 robotic arm with a Robotiq 85 gripper, performing autonomous object grasping and placement tasks in the PyBullet environment. Using inverse kinematics (IK) for precise arm control and synchronized joint control for realistic gripper motion, the robot grasps cubes from random positions and places them on a tray.",
