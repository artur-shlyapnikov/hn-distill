Plus, plain text word lists are slow to parse in the 80s; better going with a Trie or some other exotic tree structure that is naturally compressed but O(log(n)) instead of O(n) to traverse.The computer has to figure out whether the word is in the dictionary, but it also has to figure out a suggestion for what to change it to.And even after just that, we already have a bug- homonym mistakes- homonyms are in the dictionary but they’re misspelled (that was intentional btw).How misspelled is another problem.  We’ve had Levenshtein et al algorithms for a long time, but how different can you get?  A really badly misspelled word might not have any good replacement candidates within your edit distance limit.There are also optimizations like frequently mistyped words (acn-> can), acronyms, etc.It was never just about size.",

    "textPlain": "\"A Spellchecker Used to Be a Major Feat of Software Engineering\"It still is. The spell checker on my Android phone is a PIA. It's too dumb to correct many typos, there's no way of highlighting wrongly used but correct words such a 'fro' and 'for', etc. There's no automatic or user defined substitution such as correcting 'rhe' with 'the' and yet keep the words highlighted until a final revision.Wordpossessor spellers have no way of tagging certain words that one may or may not wish to use depending on context. A classic example that's caught me out past the draft and found its way into the final document without me noticing it is 'pubic' for 'public'. Why doesn't my speller highlight such words in red and ask whether I actually meant to use this word?Moreover, spellers are not all of the same level of accuracy, for example Microsoft Word's speller is much better than LibrOffice's much to my annoyance as LibreOffice is my main (preferred) WP.Nor is there a method of collecting misspelled words or typos and tagging them as spelling errors or typos for the purpose of helping one's spelling or typing. It'd be nice to have a list of my misspelled words together with their correct spelling, that way I could become a better speller. Also, spellers could be integrated with full dictionaries—highlight the word and press F1 for its meaning, etc.There are no dictionary formats that are both universal and smart, that is that would allow for easy amalgamation between dictionaries and yet could contain user defined words and other user metadata which would be distinguished from the general corpus of words when crossed or amalgamated. For example, a smart dictionary format could contain metadata that would allow a dictionary and thesaurus to coexist in the same word list, similarly so different dictionaries, technical, medical etc.All up, spellercheckers are still a damn mess. They need urgent attention.",

    "textPlain": "For checking? Just a lookup on disk (no db, just a large list with a custom index, then binary search in the retrieved block). Decoding anything was slow, and in-core was basically out of the question [1]. Caching was important, though, since just a handful of words make up 50% of the text.I once built a spell checker plus corrector which had to run in 32kB under a DOS hotkey, interacting with some word processor. On top of that, it had to run from CD ROM, and respond within a second. I could do 4 lookups, in blocks of 8kB, which gave me the option to look up the word in normal order, in reverse order, and a phonetic transcription in both directions. Each 8kB block contained quite a few words, can't remember how many. Then counting the similarities, and returning them as a sorted list. It wasn't perfect, but worked reasonably well.[1] Adding that for professional spell checking you'd need at least 100k lemmata plus all inflections plus information per word if you have to accept compounds/agglutination.",

    "textPlain": "Doesn't Chinese input usually work by typing Latin codes for characters? Korean characters represent syllables made up of shapes representing individual sounds, those fit on a keyboard just fine. And I'm not sure about Japanese, there they may use something like spell checkers to map kana to kanji.Another interesting challenge with CJK languages was just displaying them. You need higher-resolution graphics and a much bigger character ROM to even consider that.",

It's so much more than just checking is a word is spelled correctly.On the other hand, I did use Grammarly for a while and ultimately became annoyed at its tendency to keep \"re-adjusting\" sentences after it had already fixed them, so there is a fine line to walk.",
