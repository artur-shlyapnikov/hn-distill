Do you remember if at the time the first spellcheckers were invented, people were negative on spellcheckers, because that would mean that soon people would stop learning how to spell and just general dumbing down?It seems that anything that helps people gets this reaction these days. On the one hand, the argument 100% resonates with me. On the other hand, spelling isn't really the end, is it? It's just a means to an end, so what's wrong with making the mean easier? Did people worry that you'd stop knowing how to plant potatoes when trading was invented? EDIT: The example doesn't make sense because agriculture is newer than trading, but you got the idea.",

Decoding anything was slow, and in-core was basically out of the question [1]. Caching was important, though, since just a handful of words make up 50% of the text.I once built a spell checker plus corrector which had to run in 32kB under a DOS hotkey, interacting with some word processor. On top of that, it had to run from CD ROM, and respond within a second. I could do 4 lookups, in blocks of 8kB, which gave me the option to look up the word in normal order, in reverse order, and a phonetic transcription in both directions. Each 8kB block contained quite a few words, can't remember how many. Then counting the similarities, and returning them as a sorted list. It wasn't perfect, but worked reasonably well.[1] Adding that for professional spell checking you'd need at least 100k lemmata plus all inflections plus information per word if you have to accept compounds/agglutination.",
