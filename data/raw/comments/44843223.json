    "textPlain": "Having a dictionary is a prerequisite but is only a small part of the spell check problem. Plus, plain text word lists are slow to parse in the 80s; better going with a Trie or some other exotic tree structure that is naturally compressed but O(log(n)) instead of O(n) to traverse.The computer has to figure out whether the word is in the dictionary, but it also has to figure out a suggestion for what to change it to.And even after just that, we already have a bug- homonym mistakes- homonyms are in the dictionary but they’re misspelled (that was intentional btw).How misspelled is another problem.  We’ve had Levenshtein et al algorithms for a long time, but how different can you get?  A really badly misspelled word might not have any good replacement candidates within your edit distance limit.There are also optimizations like frequently mistyped words (acn-> can), acronyms, etc.It was never just about size.",

    "textPlain": "\"A Spellchecker Used to Be a Major Feat of Software Engineering\"It still is. The spell checker on my Android phone is a PIA. It's too dumb to correct many typos, there's no way of highlighting wrongly used but correct words such a 'fro' and 'for', etc. There's no automatic or user defined substitution such as correcting 'rhe' with 'the' and yet keep the words highlighted until a final revision.Wordpossessor spellers have no way of tagging certain words that one may or may not wish to use depending on context. A classic example that's caught me out past the draft and found its way into the final document without me noticing it is 'pubic' for 'public'. Why doesn't my speller highlight such words in red and ask whether I actually meant to use this word?Moreover, spellers are not all of the same level of accuracy, for example Microsoft Word's speller is much better than LibrOffice's much to my annoyance as LibreOffice is my main (preferred) WP.Nor is there a method of collecting misspelled words or typos and tagging them as spelling errors or typos for the purpose of helping one's spelling or typing. It'd be nice to have a list of my misspelled words together with their correct spelling, that way I could become a better speller. Also, spellers could be integrated with full dictionaries—highlight the word and press F1 for its meaning, etc.There are no dictionary formats that are both universal and smart, that is that would allow for easy amalgamation between dictionaries and yet could contain user defined words and other user metadata which would be distinguished from the general corpus of words when crossed or amalgamated. For example, a smart dictionary format could contain metadata that would allow a dictionary and thesaurus to coexist in the same word list, similarly so different dictionaries, technical, medical etc.All up, spellercheckers are still a damn mess. They need urgent attention.",

    "textPlain": "The way growth in memory availability changes the scope of problems is really quite astonishing. I cut my teeth writing code for Apple ][ computers with theoretically up to 128K of RAM, but in practice much closer to 40K for most use cases, but it does make me much more conscious of memory and CPU usage than younger devs who never faced these sorts of constraints.Thinking of the example given about being able to just load the word list into memory, I did something of that ilk when my son’s fifth grade class read a book which had a concept of dollar words: You assign a value to each letter, a=1, b=2, … z=26, add up the value and try to get exactly 100. It was pretty trivial to write a program that read the word list and produced the complete list of dollar words (although I didn’t share that with my son, I did give him access to the word list and challenged him to write the program himself).At the moment, I’m building up a Spanish rhyming dictionary by using a Spanish word list, reversing the words and sorting the reversed list to find the groups of words that are most likely to rhyme, which was something that 30 years ago would have been a challenge on my desktop computer but now is a brief script that I’m just as likely to manage through perl 1-liners and shell pipes as not.",

    "textPlain": "Since you're old enough, here's a question for you. Do you remember if at the time the first spellcheckers were invented, people were negative on spellcheckers, because that would mean that soon people would stop learning how to spell and just general dumbing down?It seems that anything that helps people gets this reaction these days. On the one hand, the argument 100% resonates with me. On the other hand, spelling isn't really the end, is it? It's just a means to an end, so what's wrong with making the mean easier? Did people worry that you'd stop knowing how to plant potatoes when trading was invented? EDIT: The example doesn't make sense because agriculture is newer than trading, but you got the idea.",

You'd get a word, speak it in the microphone, and get a \"score\" on how well you pronounced that word. Knowing what I know now, it was probably pretty inaccurate and hand wavy, but in the early 90s that was an absolutely amazing experience for an ESL person.",
