If we go full MBA on this, all these parties could be paying to play.  Is some journalistic ethics wall between business and editorial leaving money on the table?",

    "textPlain": "It's surprising to me that AP customer newspapers don't want book reviews to pad out their Sunday papers. Bookstores are opening more than closing in the US, and people love library apps like Libby, so you'd think they'd want reviews too. But I guess it's possible people are getting as many book recommendations as they can use from social media and TikTok and aren't interested in more detailed reviews.It doesn't surprise me that people aren't seeking out book reviews on the AP website or app—I don't think AP is particularly associated with reviews, maybe deliberately because they've historically been read in local papers that don't emphasize the AP sourcing, so people wanting reviews from a national source probably go to NYT, WaPo, WSJ, the New Yorker, etc. first.",

    "textPlain": "I honestly don't know how to feel about changes like this, but I feel like they are important. Whether they are good or bad? I'm not sure.In a sense, information is massively cheap now. You could get dozens of reviews on goodreads or any other site for a book. No, those reviews are likely not vetted, or written by credentialed individuals, but they are a solid heuristic. The decline of the professional art critic is lamentable, but it also doesn't really seem like it should be a job in the first place.I write a blog about golf, and I've examined the aesthetic underpinnings of golf course design pretty seriously: theory of reviews, axioms of frameworks and their affects on reviews, and the epistemological concerns we should have with what reviewers actually say. In the end, I think the \"named critic's opinion\" is far and away the best way to do aesthetic reviews, as long as there are a significant number of named critics. I think this is applicable to every art form.Social media has made this possible, but very few websites have actually make the matching of causal critic to a larger audience. For critical reviews to be useful, connecting large swaths of people to the nerds with correlating opinions in that art form would be a huge value add... while it's definitely doable with machine learning, nobody seems to want to recommend critics, they only recommend content. It's a bummer.If the decline of professional \"named critics who are nerds in their favorite genres\" continues, if there is no rise of casual named critics, I do think we lose something real from a functional perspective in these areas. I only hope someone can create a platform that efficiently connects interested parties in finding a casual critic who shares their aesthetic tastes.-----My writing on aesthetic theory of reviews (about golf course architecture):* A look at a functional perspective of aesthetic reviews, Howard Moskowitz, and collaborative filtering: https://golfcoursewiki.substack.com/p/golf",

It's not even close, because unless your interests are as simple as \"whatever book publishers want to sell this week\", the newspaper book reviewer just happening to cover a book up your alley is about as common as a planetary alignment.I asked ChatGPT for 20th century space operas with literary merit or lasting recognition.  It suggested Nova by Samuel Delany.  Great book.  How many newspaper book reviews would I have to read before I got suggestions for books in that category?  I'd probably die waiting.",

Or the sort that started the Spanish-American War?  If there was ever a golden age of journalists when people spat straight facts without interjecting their bias, I genuinely have no clue when it was.You can find an archive of thousands of PBS News Hour episodes online, I've watched dozens of episodes from the 80s and 90s.  This show has a tone and air of respectability, a thoughtful show for high brow people who like to consider the facts.  But that's really just the surface aesthetic.  Besides modern news shows being flagrantly tacky, the meat of what they do is the same; repeat some basic 'facts' about the story, many of which will be proven wrong in later years, then have some people selected through mysterious processes come on to talk about how the viewer should feel.  In retrospect very little of it was ever accurate and stories which seemed important then aren't in retrospect.",
