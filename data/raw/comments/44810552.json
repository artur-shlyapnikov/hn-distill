Nautilus has its own OMS system, but so does IBKR, and there is no guarantee that they are going to match.For very small funds, running entirely on IBKR platform (or Alpaca if you can live with their constraints) makes sense. For very large funds, you invariably will have a home-grown system that integrates with all of your expensive vendors. But if you are starting from scratch and want to scale up, using this to bootstrap quickly is most efficient.",

    "textPlain": "Algorithmic trading is a deep rabbit hole that will drive you mad the more you try to understand it. There are just too many variables to account for and I genuinely don't understand how you could make a stable trading system that reliably makes money as a retail trader.Excluding HFT (which is reserved for people with hundreds of millions to invest in infra, fresh Ivy league quant analysts, and a fiber optic cable hooked up directly to the exchange; they likely already have an in-house tool that does what this project does), you're really just left with intraday trading or long term investing. Investing doesn't require algorithmic trading or back testing, so it seems that this projects demographic is aimed toward intraday retail traders.With intraday trading, your chances of making a successful trading algo are near 0%. I mean, think about it: you have to account for every single variable in the stock market. How are you supposed to account for a truth social post imposing or lifting tariffs? Or a ransomware attack crippling a company? Or if a whale decides to sell all their $BIGCORP shares on the flip of a coin? It's impossible. Your only odds of success with intraday trading is manually doing it. You yourself are an \"algo\" trader that is capable of changing their strategy on the fly and accounting for unknown variables. A pre-programmed algo can not, no matter how much context you give it.Furthermore, with back testing, it's impossible to accurately capture the context of the market during that time. Let's say you back test on 180 days of data. Well, do you know exactly what happened on the 71st day of that data? Did you account for that fed meeting, that tariff hike, etc? What about all the other days? Testing on OHLCV alone is not enough; you need the entire context of the market.While the project itself it neat, I just don't see how algorithmic trading could lead to any long term success.",

Backtesting parameters, ML with smart feature selection, boosting, neural networks - everything failed out of sample. Maybe we were dumb, I don't know.2. What worked was having a clear edge:\n   - Private exchange programs with rebates for high-volume teams\n   - Pure latency arbitrage\n   - Weird arbitrage trading obscure instruments (e.g. on chain AMMs vs crypto exchange futures).Both market maker and arbitrage strategies were very sensitive to latency. We built a low-latency trading engine in Java (on top of https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue). We got 130mqs from market event to order send in a hot loop on 99.99 percentile. It was fun to optimize and benchmark.- Tail latency matters. You can have 100ms at the 90th percentile and 10-50ms at the 99.9th percentile. For low latency strategies, this is pure loss.\n- Tail latency matters even more when markets go crazy. Event rates can jump from 10 per second to 1-2k per second. If your trading engine uses trades or bid/ask events, be ready. For OHLC bars it doesn't matter, but nothing based on OHLC worked for us.---p.s.I wouldn't recommend trading to anyone. It's very stressful and exhausting. More importantly, all your hard work disappears like trying to hold sand in your hands. There's very little compounding of your work. Strategies constantly churn. You're always negotiating with managers for fees and API limits. You're always negotiating with managers for fees and API limits. They force you to buy and hold exchange tokens like Binance's BNB just to get slightly better fees, VIP status, or direct API access that bypasses firewalls.The industry is extremely secretive - it's a zero-sum game with no incentive to share anything. When you meet someone who trades, it's usually hard to have a meaningful conversation. At least that was true for me. All our strategies were small-scale an",
