    "textPlain": "From my experience, qwen3-coder is way better. I only have gpt-oss:20b installed to make a few more tests but I give it a program to make a summary of what it does and qwen3 just works in a few seconds, while gpt-oss was cancelled after 5 minuts... doing nothing.So I just use qwen3. Fast and great ouput. If for some reason I don't get what I need, I might use search engines or Perplexity.I have a 10GB 3080 and Ryzen 3600x with 32gb of RAM.Qwen3-coder is amazing. Best I used so far.",

    "textPlain": "Qwen3 is substantially better in my local testing. As in, adheres to the prompt better (pretty much exactly for the 32B parameter variant, very impressive) and is more organic sounding.In simplebench gpt-oss (120 bn) flopped hard so it doesn't appear particularly good at logical puzzles either.So presumably, this comes down to...- training technique or data- dimension- lower number of large experts vs higher number of small experts",

    "textPlain": "If I had to make a guess, I'd say this has much, much less to do with the architecture and far more to do with the data and training pipeline. Many have speculated that gpt-oss has adopted a Phi-like synthetic-only dataset and focused mostly on gaming metrics, and I've found the evidence so far to be sufficiently compelling.",
