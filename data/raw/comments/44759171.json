    "textPlain": "Is there evidence that minimizing finger movement is ergonomically desirable? It seems like \"repetitive\" is a key part of RSI, so making the exact same small motion over and over again may not be optimal.I think about piano players, who obviously need to move their hands and arms a lot to hit the keys (and with more force). Definitely takes a lot more energy than typing on a computer keyboard, but is there evidence that it's any more or less likely to cause injury?",

Like a coworker helping you to check something, for which I just leave them the controls; or a partner doing a quick google while we discuss about where to travel next. I'm just making up scenarios, but the point is that not having an additional backup keyboard effectively makes the machine unusable for anyone else; this could jokingly be a pro, but more seriously it seems to be a hidrance for collaboration. And unless living in a cave, we collaborate with other human beings  sooner or later. So an additional keyboard it is...the same happened to me when I used the Elecom Huge trackball... I'd want someone to check something and they wouldn't even know how to left click :) (it's done with the thumb)",

    "textPlain": "The progression from unergonomic garbage default to splits and ~glovey form makes sense (with the future more sensitive per-finger sensors allowing for more gestures?), though it's a pity the health issues were involved, and that the resulting niche is small and expensive. Where are all the cheep rubber dome splits? Those would already offer health advantage without the mechanical premium...By the way, the layout might better use physical direction mnemonics, so backspace could be a finger move to the left, and delete - move to the right (either by the same finger or maybe by its mirrored counterpart on another hand). Similar thing for <> and -+-+> north keys are much harder to hit than its south keys, \n> find the inward lateral keys much easier to hit than the north keysSo, basically, \"grabbing\" movements are more natural?",

Maybe something designed for steno or whatever. It would be cool if I could just hold it in my hands, since often that'd be more comfortable than the surface my laptop is on.",

We need programming languages that are much more keyword- rather than symbol-heavy, or more efficient systems of pronouncing symbols, or higher-level editing primitives, or maybe all of the above. There's some overlap with both stenography (which I know some people use for code, but I've never got around to setting up a theory for) and also structured editing projects like Hazel.  Reckon we might see more of it in the future, if we're to make the ubiquitous and malleable computing dreams a reality.",
