The solution they offer to founders is to make the user your champion and have them sell your product for you.\"The meta point here is that you're not going to talk to the credit card holder; the user/dev is going to do that for you.Give them the best possible chance at convincing the leadership. Make them look awesome for even bothering the leadership with a choice like this. Make it obviously awesome for them to decide “yes”. These users/devs are your sales people.\"Maybe that works for dev tools with freemium models, but in many industries where this problem arises its just not possible to even get your product in front of the users.  Take hospital systems and EHR purchasing where  Doctors and Nurses are the users of the EHR day in and day out but it is the hospital administration that ultimately gets to decide which EHR is deployed.  How do you get users to be champions of your product if you can't even get it in front of them?",

We were able to sell to smaller companies and larger ones that happened to have people who had enough power to purchase. But the majority of companies had super long sales cycles where we had to work with them to prove out the cost savings to people higher up. Most of the time this went nowhere and cost us a ton of time. It wasn't the only reason the company failed, but a major contributing factor. Glad to see people talking about it because it's something a lot of small b2b companies face and there's surprisingly little advice on it.",

    "textPlain": "Employees, by and large, all share three common desires:* How do I get promoted?* How do I get a raise?* How do I not get fired?Beyond those common desires are a constellation of more personalized that is specific for each salesperson and the cohort they target (I'm somewhat of an idealist in that I believe people are quite often strongly driven by meaningful non-capitalist, non-realist desires).In any case, when you're working in enterprise sales, what you have to realize is that, regardless of what the desire is, what your corporate champion is \"buying\" is a way for them to achieve their goals and only incidentally what is good for the company, where your product is merely a proxy to accomplishing this.Of course, companies also know this and anyone who has owned a P&L immediately recognizes that the sum of all things everyone wants far exceeds the resources of the balance sheet, thus, some selection process needs to be put in place to allocate scarce resources.Your corporate champion is ideally far more aligned with you against the company than they are with the company against you and your job is to figure out how to win this selection battle together.The core insight though, is that people are actually astonishingly bad at performing on this and it's actually quite easy for an outside sales person to become a subject matter expert for 3 core reasons:1. Any employee usually only ever has a sample size of 1 whereas you have a broader peek into how this has happened across a range of companies industry wide.2. Any employee, only a minor part of their job involves interfacing with outside parts of the firm responsible for allocating resources whereas you treat this as a core competency.3. For any person, it's always easier to advise a 3rd party on what to do than to practice the same actions yourself.What this means though, is that, as an enterprise salesperson, you should understand that your core value comes from developing subject matter expertise in how to help ",

I could be wrong, but it took a few years for the manufacturers to start including remote starters as an add-on. Before then, it was all kinds of other shops selling and installing them.But its a trench warfare type of deal.
