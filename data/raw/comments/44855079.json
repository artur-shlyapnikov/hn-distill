    "textPlain": "I'm not a native English speaker, but to me \"try and\" has always conveyed a sense of more deliberate trying, of getting over yourself, in the sense that the \"try\" means the choice to give it a real proper go. So first you try (or, in fact, decide to try) and then when you're fully committed and mentally prepared, then you do it.With an interpretation like this, none of the syntactical stuff in this story seems useful anymore. You try, and then you do.Does this make any sense at all or am I just a foreigner imagining things?",
