So we have the same thing in Norwegian writing, but if you happen to use \"and\", you must use the imperative form of the verb for it to be grammatically correct. So, \"try to stop me\" is \"prøv å stoppe meg\", and \"try and stop me\" is \"prøv og stopp meg\". The latter is much more colloquial.This isn't a problem in Swedish and Danish, as their infinitive marker is \"att/at\", which in Norwegian only means \"that\" in its conjunctive form.I wonder if there's any relation to the Norwegian here.",

Which seems related here. “I’m going to take a shower and get this dirt off me” or “I’m going to get some flour and bake a cake.” You can’t change the order. It doesn’t make sense to add both in those cases, either.It’s also interesting about motion verbs, because I see “he came and picked me up at the station” as an example of two literal sequential actions, versus “he went and picked me up at the station” as more about emphasis, like he did something notable. Which could be good or bad: “he went and got himself arrested again.”",
