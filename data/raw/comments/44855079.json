So we have the same thing in Norwegian writing, but if you happen to use \"and\", you must use the imperative form of the verb for it to be grammatically correct. So, \"try to stop me\" is \"prøv å stoppe meg\", and \"try and stop me\" is \"prøv og stopp meg\". The latter is much more colloquial.This isn't a problem in Swedish and Danish, as their infinitive marker is \"att/at\", which in Norwegian only means \"that\" in its conjunctive form.I wonder if there's any relation to the Norwegian here.",

    "textPlain": "> regular coordination permits the order of conjuncts to be changed, while in (7) we see that the same is not possible with try and (De Vos 2005:59).But sometimes conjunction implies sequential order or causation, right? Which seems related here. “I’m going to take a shower and get this dirt off me” or “I’m going to get some flour and bake a cake.” You can’t change the order. It doesn’t make sense to add both in those cases, either.It’s also interesting about motion verbs, because I see “he came and picked me up at the station” as an example of two literal sequential actions, versus “he went and picked me up at the station” as more about emphasis, like he did something notable. Which could be good or bad: “he went and got himself arrested again.”",

The \"X-te\" (Xて) is technically not X in present tense, it is specifically X in the te-form (て is read \"te\").The te-form has a bunch of different uses, but in the case of \"verb-te verb\", if the second verb is not one of a list of special verbs (of which miru (見る, to see) is one), X-te Y normally means \"X and Y\". For example, yorugohan o tsukutte taberu (夜ご飯を作って食べる) means \"(to/I/we/you/...) make dinner and eat it\": yorugohan is dinner, the \"o\" is a particle marking the direct object, tsukuru means to make (becomes tsukutte in the te-form) and taberu means to eat. (The first word in English is ambiguous because grammatical subjects are usually optional in Japanese, plus its verbs are not inflected for person or number.)For a number of verbs, however, if they are in the second position, the phrase gets a special meaning. If it's miru, e.g. tsukutte miru, it means \"to try to make\" — or perhaps more aptly, \"to try and make\". If it's iku (行く, to go), it means \"to go X-ing\": tabete iku (where taberu (to eat) -> tabete in the te-form) is \"to go to eat [something]\", or perhaps: \"to go and eat [something]\".Not all such special verbs correspond to English pseudocoordination though; a common one is shimau (the dictionary says \"to finish / to stop\", but it's uncommon in bare form), where e.g. tabete shimau means \"to finish eating\" or \"to end up eating\" / \"to eat accidentally\" depending on context.The analogy between English and Japanese here is likely coincidental, but it's amusing nevertheless.",

Also listen for would've / could'veBut listening to https://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/should_of_would_of_c... made me wonder if people do clearly pronounce the \"of\" in \"should of\"... Now I'm worried that I'm going to hear the mistake and be annoyed.There is nothing more annoying than being told something annoying, and then learning to be annoyed by it.Try not to internalise that dictum or it will recursively annoy you.Next time you hear a really annoying vague repetitive sound at work, mention it to a coworker if you wish to ruin their worklife.",

    "textPlain": "Do you mean \"should've\"? That's a common contraction of \"should\" and \"have.\" In many American accents, the difference between \"should've\" and \"should have\" is negligible, and will sound like \"should of\" even though it isn't.It also depends on the audience and medium, with \"should've\" being more appropriate for conversational/informal usage. It would be perfectly normal to say something like \"he shouldn't've done that,\" but if I were writing a message, I'd at least expand the last contraction to \"have.\"I think there's a general perception that many of the common dialects of American English, especially in the South and West, are associated with being less educated. I am not sure where that comes from.I'm a native English speaker, and my perception is that when someone speaks in a way where they don't use contractions, it seems verbose and stilted; I associate it with being scolded or disciplined, or when someone is speaking sternly to make a point (or out of anger).\nE.g.:\n\"You don't know where you're going, you should've taken a left\" - informative/neutral\n\"You do not know where you are going, you should have taken a left\" - critical/scoldingOmitting contractions can result in speech that sounds strange and unnatural in general:\n\"Shouldn't we go?\"  -> \"Should not we go?\"\n\"Aren't you coming?\" -> \"Are not you coming?\"\n\"We didn't, but we should've.\" -> \"We did not, but we should have.\"",
