American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Classification Society Background\" ... \"The ABS Underwater Rules do not permit the use of carbon fiber composites for Pressure Vessels for Human Occupancy (PVHOs)\"\"4.2.4.5. Det Norske Veritas and Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL)\" ... 4.2.4.5.3. According to a DNV Surveyor, carbon fiber has not been accepted as suitable material for the construction of submersible PVHOs, especially when subject to external pressure experienced at ocean depths. According to DNV GL, carbon fibers are not considered suitable for significant compressive loading conditions.\"\"5.1. Inadequacy of Structural Engineering Analysis.\nOceanGate’s TITAN submersible design was a complex, high-risk, deep-sea submersible. The design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that are considered crucial for ensuring safety and reliability for operations in such an inherently hazardous environment...\"\"5.6 Insufficient Understanding of Carbon Fiber Material Properties for Deep-Sea Application.\nThe TITAN’s pressure hull was constructed using carbon fiber, a material chosen by Mr. Rush for its “impressive” strength-to-weight ratio. [However] the use of carbon fiber in deep-sea environments remains unproven—unlike the materials with established safety records. There are currently no recognized national or international standards that approve of the use of carbon fiber pressure hulls for submersibles. Carbon fiber has demonstrated its effectiveness in other applications where the material is primarily under tension (e.g., aircraft hulls where the pressure inside the passenger compartment is pressing outwards). However, in deep-sea conditions, the pressure hull experiences extreme compressive forces, a scenario for which carbon fiber has no established track record and is",

He was careless with peoples lives, but his sub actually did what he set out to do, and if he listened to the instruments, he'd still be alive, he could have made another hull, and he could be taking more trips down there for better of for worse. The porthole design was poor, the carbon fiber had tons of defects, the controller, everything was cobbled together, yet it held up until it didn't.",

    "textPlain": "Fiber-reinforced composites are basically analogous to spaghetti dispersed in glue. Really strong in tension, when the (in this case, carbon) fibers are taking nearly all of the load. In compression, the fibers have nearly zero resistance to flexure, and the load is mainly being taken up by the glue (the matrix, in composite-speak). When the fiber/matrix interface fails due to fiber flex-induced shear force, you're done.I just can't imagine why a submersible structural designer would select composites for this application. IMHO, this project was doomed from the moment of that design decision, even setting aside all the other idiocy.",
