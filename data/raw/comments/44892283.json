It's first of all not clear such a scenario leads to runaway wealth for a few, even though with no outside events that may be the outcome. However, such scenarios are so unsustainable and catastrophic it's hard to imagine there are no catastrophic reactions to it. How is the market supposed to react if there's a large chance of market collapse and also a large chance of runaway wealth creation? Besides the point that in an economy where AI surpass humans the demands of the market will shift drastically too. Which I also think is underrepresented in predictions, which is the induced demand of AI-replaced labor and the potential for entire industries to be decimated by secondary effects instead of direct AI competition/replacement at labor scale.",

Social networking, mobile computing, and cloud computing have all done more to alter society and daily life than has AI.And yes, I recognize that AI has already created profound change, in that every software engineer now depends heavily on copilots, in that education faces a major integrity challenge, and in that search has been completely changed. I just don't think those changes are on the same level as the normalization of cutting-edge computers in everyone's pockets, as our personal relationships becoming increasingly online, nor as the enablement for startups to scale without having to maintain physical compute infrastructure.To me, the treating of AI as \"different\" is still unsubstantiated. Could we get there? Absolutely. We just haven't yet. But some people start to talk about it almost in a way that's reminiscent of Pascal's Wager, as if the slight chance of a godly reward from producing AI means it is rational to devote our all to it.

As companies drop more employees moving towards fully automated closed loop production their consumer market fails faster than they can reach a zero cost.Nonetheless I do still believe humans will continue to be the more cost efficient way to come up with and guide new ideas. Many human performed services will remain desirable because of its virtue and our sense of emotion and taste for a moment that other humans are feeling too.

Until we achieve that, I'm not sure there's really as much to fear as everyone thinks.We still need humans in the loop as of now. These tools are still very far from being good enough to fully autonomously manage each other and manage systems, and, arguably, because the systems we build are for humans we will always need humans to understand them to some extent. LLMs can replace labor, but they cannot replace human intent and teleology. One day maybe they will achieve intentions of their own, but that is an entirely different ballgame. The economy ultimately is a battle of intentions, resources, and ends. And the human beings will still be a part of this picture until all labor can be fully automated across the entire suite of human needs.We should also bear in mind our own bias as \"knowledge workers\". Manual laborers arguably already had their analogous moment. The encoding kept on humming. There isn't anything particularly special about \"white collar\" work in that regard.

Then new jobs were created in factories, and then many of those jobs were replaced by robots.Somehow many idiotic white collar jobs have been created over the years. How many web applications and websites are actually needed? When I was growing up, the primary sources of knowledge were teachers, encyclopedias, and dictionaries, and those covered a lot. For the most part, we’ve been inventing problems to solve and wasting a tremendous amount of resources.Some wrote malware or hacked something in attempt to keep this in check, but harming and destroying just means more resources used to repair and rebuild and real people can be hurt.At some point in coming years many white collar workers will lose their jobs again, and there will be too many unemployed because not enough blue collar jobs will be available.There won’t be some big wealth redistribution until AI convinces people to do that.The only answer is to create more nonsense jobs, like AI massage therapist and robot dog walker.",
