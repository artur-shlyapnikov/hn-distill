You don't need any offshore shenanigans to get around it.If you just want to move out of the country you can also just keep the ownership of the company within the country. You do this by putting your shares into a holding that stays in Germany even when you move out. That holding needs to be managed within Germany, so you need to assign a friend or be in Germany twice a year to sign off on having done the management within Germany.You do need a bit more expensive tax advisor, but it's not that difficult. There's a description here: https://www.juhn.com/fachwissen/internationales-steuerrecht/... (3.1.)Of course, if you want to move the company out of the country, you'll need to pay taxes on any value increase the company had. As others have described this is pretty reasonable though - you get taxed exactly as if gains were realized. This is tax you would have had to pay some time in the future anyways, except by moving to a tax-evasion country.The only unreasonable part of the law is how they can assume your valuation based on earnings, but that only applies if you can't provide a valuation based on German standards.",

    "textPlain": "It’s not as crazy as it initially seems.It’s because of a fundamental difference between how capital gains tax and income tax are collected.Capital gains are deferred - so as years pass you’re working up a tax liability but most countries recognize that forcing collection every year is not practical given the often illiquid nature of capital gains and the difficulty around valuation.I’m from a country which has no exit tax on capital gains and notoriously a certain wealthy telecoms magnet - having been resident all his life - moved to Portugal just before realizing billions of capital gain.  Thus despite earning multiple billions through businesses activities in his native country, he effectively paid zero tax.I myself have benefited from this lack of capital gain exit tax as I moved to a country with very low capital gains tax.  So despite the fact that my modest equity portfolio earned most of its growth while I was living in Ireland, when I sell, the Irish government will get nothing.The problem, it seems to me is the method of valuation for the deemed disposal and/or the fact that it can cause a “liquidity squeeze“ for the tax payer.I don’t see a simple solution - maybe other than getting rid of capital gains taxes completely and collecting more consumption taxes, for example, but I’m sure this would just open up a range of other tax evading loopholes.",

For the non-Americans out there, this is basically one city but it sits at the border of two states. So the two states are constantly torching money to lure businesses that play this system and simply go back and forth.I believe this situation will come to an end and there are several reasons for this:1. For the EU in particular, reliance on US tech giants is increasingly becoming a security issue. The Eu will increasingly wants homegrown alternatives so the option of leaving will simply not exist because you could leave but then you lose the EU as a customer;2. For a long time multinational companies used transfer pricing to avoid paying taxes. What's transfer pricing? Let's say you buy a sofa in China for @200, ship it to the US for another $200 and then sell it for $1000. You've made a gross profit of $600. What if instead you have a subsidiary in Vanuatu, which has no corporate income tax (AFAIK), and it buys the sofas for $400 and sell them to the US company for $950? Well, you've booked $550 in profit where there's no tax and only $50 profit where there is.That's technically illegal. It's often-called transfer pricing manipulation.So what do tech giants like Google do? They sell their IP to an Irish subsidiary. There's a nominal process to make sure this is done for a \"fair\" value (according to the IRS). Then they pay royalties to their own Irish subsidiary to shift profits to a lower tax regime. Previously, this created a problem because they couldn't repatriate the money without paying (then) 30%+ corporate taxes but this all changed in 2017 with a tax holiday and a change to how this kind of income was treated.
