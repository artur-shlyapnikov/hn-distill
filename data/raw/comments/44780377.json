If being understood by everyone wasn't required, I wonder if one could learn to boost both send and receive rates?",

    "textPlain": "I have always wondered if transmission bitrate remains the same for the same language, spoken at seemingly different speeds.There is that stereotype that french-speaking Swiss people speak slower than French ones. In my experience I find it valid, but maybe I am wrong.If this is accurate, I am wondering if Swiss people transmit information at the same rate as French people.It could be that they use more precise words on average, that convey more information, even if spoken more slowly, and keeping transmission rate identical. Or that body language, intonations are richer (non verbal).Or the spoken transmission rate may actually be slower, but as the article describes, bottleneck is about structuring the ideas, and Swiss speakers, on average, may be more efficient/deliberate at that, instinctively/culturally.I don't have enough experience speaking with Swiss nationals to verify my anecdotal theories... if anyone can chime in...",

    "textPlain": "The paper does not seem to support that human speech has a universal transmission rate or that every spoken language has a universal information rate.  They showed that information rate varied by individual and by language, just that it varied less than the syllable rate.This was also bounded by a reading task, so the performance shown per language could be influenced by the average reading skills of people who speak those languages.  They also asked them to pronounce differently than they normally would.If you take the 17 languages they tested and get the average between them, you get 39bits/s.  For English and French, the information rate they recorded was higher, with an average closer to ~45bits/s (just eyeballing their chart).  Their results also showed Thai at ~35bits/s.  A 10bits/s swing from median to median is pretty huge.From the paper:\"We collected recordings of 170 native adult speakers of the aforementioned 17 languages, each reading at their normal rate a standardized set of 15 semantically similar texts across the languages (for a total amount of approximately 240,000 syllables). Speakers became familiar with the texts, by reading them several times before being recorded, so that they understand the described situation and minimize reading errors\"\"Together, our findings show that while there is wide interspeaker variation in speech and IRs (information rates), this variation is also structured by language. This means that an individual’s speech behavior is not entirely due to individual characteristics but is further constrained by the language being spoken.\"\"However, languages seem to stably inhabit an optimal range of IRs, away from the extremes that can still be available to individual speakers. Languages achieve this balance through a trade-off between ID (information density) and SR (syllable rate), resulting in a narrower distribution of IRs compared to SRs. In the introduction, we rhetorically asked whether too low or too high an IR would imped",

Or are bits counting a simple abstraction over syllables, similar to a token? Language is compression. And while humans may transmit at a universal rate, maybe some languages/cultures have a more dense compression of ideas than others?
