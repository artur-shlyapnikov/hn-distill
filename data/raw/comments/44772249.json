    "textPlain": "> Neither parapsychology, nor any science, can thrive without them.This is an absurd article. Scepticism is not the psychological disposition to treat the increasingly implausible with the same equanimity as the increasingly plausible. The sceptic is under no obligation to ignore decades or centuries of science, nor be partisan to no established body of knowledge.Sceptics are at their very best profoundly partisan to such bodies of knowledge, and at the same time, very mindful and knowledgeable about their limitations. Otherwise scepticism is just paranoia or gullibility.This is an article in praise of gullibility as the highest form of scepticism, a very common attempted rebuke to sceptics when one has failed to meet the reasonable standard of evidence they demand.It is also a subtle ad-hom, it says, \"look at some of the mild hubris and minor moral failures of some particular sceptics\" whilst sneaking its way to, \"Neither parapsychology, nor any science, can thrive without them.\". As if there is a connection.The principled and knowlegable sceptic, who is not credulous nor obnoxious, not paranoid nor overly trusting -- this is a person in 2025 who would give no time to \"parapsychology\" because of the decades of time already given, to great effect. There is no science there, no truth, nothing.",

    "textPlain": "> “I found myself attacked by the Committee members and board, who considered me to be too soft on the paranormalists,”It is actually a pretty interesting point to consider deeply. Engaging with people from a position of constructive scepticism does require going in with an open mind that could realistically be changed. However, anyone who has done that once or twice quickly realises that:1) Most people appear to have avoided thinking critically about any of their beliefs at all. At best they are repeating poorly-understood arguments from other people they respect, at worst they are playing team sports.2) Many topical problems appear to have been settled decades or centuries ago and people are just not interested in the problems they are professing to be concerned about. This happens a lot in politics; it is wildly unusual for a new topic to come before a legislative body and most policies that make it through the process haven't been thoughtfully assessed in terms of what happened the last time people tried it. The fact that people want to tinker with the laws at all is actually a pretty big tell that the process is weird - the situation a society faces doesn't change so quickly that the laws need to be adjusted every year. It should be a rather rare thing.It requires a sophisticated understanding of the world and an unusual grasp of empathy to maintain a level of honest scepticism in the face of those two dynamics. Trying to have a conversation about why people believe something just turns up the answer that they do and they don't have any particular reason. Most of the time there isn't anything to discuss or dig in to.",

Obviously also some weirdos with wacky ideas showed up at the venue. I will always remember how Marino, one of the senior members, used to interact with them: he didn’t take them seriously, but he made them feel heard. I bet many of them came ready for a “fight” (or to be ridiculed) and they found enough respect to be content and leave in peace.",

During my life, I met two \"belligerent skeptic\" types, who, as mentioned in this essay, were more interested in personal attacks than anything else.Both came from families where they were force-fed religion at young age and this was their method of revenge.While I understand their motivation, it is a \"two wrongs don't make a right\" situation.

The show mainly is a discussion of general science news from a skeptical lens. Their attitude towards the paranormal stuff is pretty dismissive, but this is because they've engaged with the believers for decades and have discovered a complete disregard for evidence or truth in those communities.I also really the movie \"behind the curve\", which goes deep into the flat earth movement. Really a great way to understand what motivates these people (status in their community, mostly) and how they think (with lots of bias).",

    "textPlain": "It should be noted that the author thinks ESP is a Thing, and it's worthy of study / research. They're essentially concern-trolling / no-true-scotsman-ing  skeptics - that they're not the right kind of skeptics or occasionally skeptics also did misleading things, and bullied those poor poor ESP researchers and hurt the field of ESP research and that's why we don't hwave any proof ESP is a thing. That a skeptic didn't perfectly skeptic-ize a ESP researcher (or two, or three) doesn't mean ESP research has the slightest legitimacy or value because regardless of a skeptic's methods, the burden of evidence on something as extraordinary as ESP is purely on the researcher claiming ESP exists.Of James Randi, he complains in another article (which for some reason BoingBoing published...) on his site: \"[Randi made] it more difficult for serious university-based and academically trained researchers to study ESP and mental anomalies, and to receive a fair hearing in the news media.\"Uh....Yes? That was the point? Randi dedicated his time and energy to debunking shysters. At best they were seeking fame while popularizing paranormal crap and hurting scientific literacy...and at worst taking advantage of people finanically to varying degrees.TV used to be awash in idiots claiming to be psychic or able to do absurd things like magnetize their bodies with their mind. I remember Randi was on such a show with such a \"magnetic\" person, watched them stick something metal to their body...then he whips out a container of baby powder, applies it to the guy who claimed to be able to magnetize himself...and wouldn't you know, the \"magnetism\" disappeared....because the reason something metal stuck to him was because his sweaty skin had enough stiction (and probably using some rosin to 'help') and use a part of their body angled a bit from vertical. And Randi then demonstrates this, showing he can \"magnetize\" himself, too.Randi was a magician, saw people abusing lazy/shitty magic to rip people ",

    "textPlain": "My form of skepticism is just waiting for proof. Happy to wait. Costs me nothing. Just get the proof from your hands to mine without it vanishing into smoke.I think software engineering opens the mind a little to being willing to believe things that should be impossible. Some of my bugs are certainly ghost stories: \"...and the programmer never figured out how something that weird could be happening!\" Others have pushed me to the brink of questioning my own sanity, only to have it all snap back into place when the explanation is finally laid bare.While I have no particular reason to \"believe in ESP\" it is impossible not to recognize the very real state it puts a person in to have seen some kind of evidence that nobody else will believe, and I don't necessarily see any reason to suppose that someone somewhere in this psychic card testing didn't see evidence of some real information transfer effect. But what effect?We know beyond doubt that people can pick up on perceptual signals without really understanding what we're picking up on. I once had the strange experience of \"seeing\" a cat in pitch black because I was creeping up some stairs and the cat was a few feet directly in front of my head. I'll swear to you up and down that I never saw it with my eyes, though I couldn't say for sure. I'm convinced that I actually heard it, not even its breathing but the lack of any ambient room noise coming from directly in front of me caused an immediate cognitive dissonance in some part of my brain that knew nothing should be there to absorb sound. In the immediate moment this led to my knowing something irretrievably that at the time I really could not say how I knew. But also I was blessed with proof. I reached out, and there was a cat there.I guess my point is that the most logical explanation to me is that in a card-guessing experiment you have two players who keep careful records but who both want the guessing game to be won by the guesser. You're allowed to keep playing wit",

    "textPlain": "What I found most interesting in the article was the frank acknowledgement by J B Rhine that Walter Levy, director of the Institute for Parapsychology was committing fraud.I view research into parapsychology with a background assumption that I understand the motivation. Reductionist materialism suggests that death is the end. Parapsychology may imply the existence of souls, a spiritual realm, life after death, and maybe the chance of heaven. What wonderful balm for existential angst!Does this make me doubt research into parapsychology? No, quite the opposite. A researcher can only soothe the pain of existential angst with genuine results. If they fake the research, they know that they faked it, and it provides no consolation. My take is that I cannot dismiss positive results in parapsychology as fraud.Grifters are real. It is possible in principle that researchers in parapsychology are faking results with an eye to making money selling pills that \"boost your ESP\". I think that I am able to spot and dismiss grifts without difficulty, and that it is not what is at issue here.But now I learn that I'm wrong. Walter Levy's results are fake. I have to flip from modus ponens to modus tollens. Instead of saying \"I understand the motivation, therefore Levy's results are genuine\", I have to say \"Levy's results are fake, therefore I don't understand the motivation\".I'm in a pickle. A central principle of how I understand the world is that fraud is motivated. No motive, no fraud. Now what? Since there is motiveless fraud, much of what I thought I knew about the world is on shaky ground.",
