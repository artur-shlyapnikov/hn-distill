They had archaic hardware still, and had to fly in some one from the UK (fully pensioned and well) to service it",

Also amazing that up until way in the 2000s I knew people who relied on it as the primary source for basic headlines, weather, but also traffic information on trains as well as expected landing times for airplanes. Of course the football standings in the Dutch Eredivisie was possibly the most viewed page of all.

I had rediscovered teletext for myself a few years ago, only vaguely remembering it existed (or something similar) in select cities in the US when I was a kid, but it was not something I paid much attention to. Getting interested, I began to wonder if you can set up your own teletext service.Naturally, you can: https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/create-your-own-teletext-se...For those like me who weren't familiar with the service or lived in a country that really didn't have it, there's this informative site: https://teletextarchaeologist.org/Edit: Sorry all, it looks like teletextarcheologist.org went dormant, so the archive no longer seems to be working.",

I assume it is benefiting from modern fonts on that page and didn't look like that in the 90s?It re-confirms my view that the terminal can be a great way to consume news if the content is specifically created for that format. Just using elinks to browse news websites doesn't really work well these days. I wonder if there are any telnet-based news services (or similar) out there still.",
