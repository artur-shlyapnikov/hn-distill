I searched for the numbers of teletext users in my home country and it turns out that Teletext remains surprisingly popular in Austria (~ 9m inhabitants) with ~ 780,000 daily users in 2023 [1].So, approximately 8.5 % of Austria’s total population used Teletext every day in 2023. never would have expected this...[1] https://der.orf.at/medienforschung/online/teletext/index.htm...",
