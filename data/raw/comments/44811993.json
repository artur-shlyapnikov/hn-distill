It is extendable, unrestricted, can be isolated from workstations, desk, etc. Complete it with a fire extinguisher nearby should be a good setup.Look for Ikea Pegboard Charging Stations if you want some inspiration.",

    "textPlain": "Speaking of charging setups: I have a wide selection of battery-powered tools all running the same standard of battery (Ryobi, but that's but immigrant, the other manufacturers have the same products). Week, actually, it's two, one for the big machines like the lawnmower and chainsaw, and one for the small ones like the drill. But one of the items is a battery dock using the  big battery, a 4 amp-hr li-ion brick. It offers a standard mains socket (as well as USB-A and USB-C sockets) in which I plug my laptop when I work from home on my front porch or a smart-speaker when we want music outside.For my laptop, one battery adds at least 80% to my battery time, plus I don't get down-throttled for being in battery power only, giving me about 4 hours at full power and another 5 on regular battery thereafter, plus the batteries are hot-swappable.You can buy external battery backups specifically intended for electronic devices for significantly more money and they only give you one charge.EDIT: example link https://www.ryobitools.com/products/46396026651",

    "textPlain": "Every battery & charger & their uncle is adding retractable cables.I get the attraction, but I detest it! USB-C male jacks are designed to fail. All of these systems are designed to fail!Thankfully usb-c's a lot more rugged, lasts a lot longer than previous designs. But there's still limits! Throwing out a whole charger or battery because the cable goes bad like this is so gross. Ideally there'd be a design where the retractable cable could appear built-in, but would at least be replaceble. That would be fine! But this retractable cable trend: it's a forced push towards disposable electronics.",
