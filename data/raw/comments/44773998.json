    "textPlain": "This is exactly the kind of obvious mistake that contributes to the complexity of explaining education outcomes. Requiring a \"teacher recommendation\" to allow a student to take an advanced course introduces bias and consequently is suboptimal to say the least.That the following had to be done is sadly the state of affairs in the US:> In 2018, North Carolina passed House Bill 986, Session Law 2018-32, which included Part II: Enrollment in Advanced Mathematics Courses. This legislation established § 115C-81.36, requiring that \"any student scoring a level five on the standardized test for the mathematics course in which the student was most recently enrolled shall be enrolled in the advanced course for the next mathematics course in which the student is enrolled.\"Edit to add:This is also the kind of thing that machine learning/\"algo\" skeptics/detractors skip over or ignore when evaluating automation: humans are often wrong.",

I have long been bitter that I had taken algebra in 8th grade, and starting high school in 9th grade they made me take algebra again because I was told I couldn’t skip ahead that far. I was too young to be in the class. For the record, I’m white snd middle class, so don’t fit that pattern, but I am neuro diverse. Anyhow, everyone has excused it at the time with shit like it must have been a technicality, or that the algebra was more advanced, or something along those lines. Anyhow, it’s nice to be validated sometimes, and this is one of those times so I thought I’d share.",

Crazy to think of a framing that 'advanced' 6th grade math is such a precious resource that your 5th grade teacher can arbitrarily shunt you down an academic path all the way to college. It feels like this exists mostly to create a have and have-nots situation.",
