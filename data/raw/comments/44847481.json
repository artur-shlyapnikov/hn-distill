Not only are the crimes of communism not condemned, but they are by and large not known.Right, so it was this particular implementation of communism, epitomized by Stalin’s policies.",

    "textPlain": "The 170MM figure is referring to all losses of life like the purges, man-made famines as well as “unborn” children.  This last one has no reference so it’s impossible to know what that means or how many people they attribute to that.That said, the problem is a cultural one.  The communists poured gas on the tendencies of the Tsars and modern Russia suffers from that legacy still.Culture is hard to cure and the change has to come from within.  Japan had a similar problem but most of the sharp edges were dulled when they made a deal (surrender) with the Americans.You also see this tendency to cling to bad cultural habits by some enclaves of immigrants.  It can take decades of new generations to wipe some of those bad tendencies away. Some people see that as erasure of culture as a bad thing but it can also bring good.",
