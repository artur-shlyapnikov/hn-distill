    "textPlain": "It's pretty wild that software is the only \"engineering\" discipline without any concept of professional ethics or loyalty to human safety that superceeds the whims of the employer.Why do people think that is? Have there been any attempts to change this from the inside over the past decade? Where are  professional associations like the ACM in all of this? It's a shameful state of affairs and reflects poorly on the whole discipline.People who design bridges and vehicles have real responsibilities and standards they are held to, yet somehow the software that actually runs these things is exempt.This is how Boeing negligently murdered hundreds of people with MCAS. By taking responsibility for safety away from actual engineers and misplacing it with people who write software.",

    "textPlain": ">But surely the real problem is a systemic one and you can’t blame the workers for participating. After all, they are just trying to feed themselves and get healthcare. And, that is correct, of course. What’s also correct is that systems are powered by people. They rely on the labor of people to functionThat statement is pivotal and one which people really need to be called out on when they use it as a crutch.\"Don't hate the player, hate the game\"... Motherfucker there's only a game because of the players!",
