These larvae can infest wounds of any warm-blooded animal, including human beings. The screwworm fly is about twice the size of a regular house fly and can be distinguished by its greenish-blue color and its large reddish-orange eyes.Infestations can occur in any open wound, including cuts, castration wounds, navels of newborn animals, and tick bites. The wounds often contain a dark, foul-smelling discharge. Screwworm larvae distinguish themselves from other species by feeding only on the living flesh, never dead tissue. Once a wound is infested, the screwworm can eventually kill the animal or human, literally eating it alive.\" - Sounds great.",

There are thousands of types of dangerous larvae that can infect via the eyes rubbing the eyes or the nose picking ones nose when handling raw meats and vegetables.  Cutting meat slices thinner and cooking them well kills larvae.  Marinating meats with something that contains acetic acid also helps.  Stomach acid takes care of the rest.Beware of the fear porn spreading around this issue.  I have already seen articles posted showing what happens when rubbing ones eyes or picking ones nose after handling raw food and of course it is horrific but screw worms are just one of many real risks.  Food handlers in first world countries are taught not to touch their faces and to wear gloves among many other safety practices with raw meats and vegetables.  Everyone both vegetarian and carnivore unknowingly eat many types of larvae, bacteria, mold, fungus and insects all the time.I know I will get beat up for going against the agenda but I am that guy.",

Biodiversity is vast, this isn't easy.Companies that anticipate this (we know we're going to get a billion requests for \"what's this fly\", how can we monitize this?), and also actully understand that species are literally invaluable lab experiments running millions of years, are bound to benefit.
