    "textPlain": "That form of migration is happening all over the world right now.Virginia opossums, traditionally associated with the deep south, are now routinely spotted around Toronto, and are moving even further north.  Armadillos, though still shy of the Canadian border, have crossed the Ohio River.  American alligators, long stopped around Cape Hatteras, are now spotted in the tidal creeks of Virginia’s Eastern Shore. [1] Lobsters are moving north to the Canadian Maritimes from New England, and the blue crabs of Chesapeake Bay are filling the niches they're leaving behind.It's much the same way in Europe.  The European praying mantis used to be a hot-climate central Italian and Balkan insect.  Now it's routinely spotted in Germany, has been found as far north as Latvia, and I found one in the usually-chilly Slovenian mountains just the other day!Wherever you are on the map, look at the climate and ecosystem a few hundred miles south.  That's likely where things are heading for you; it's a safe bet that the species that thrive there are the ones that are going to be best adapted to where you live in the second half of the 21st century.[1] - https://defenders.org/blog/2023/12/why-we-almost-said-see-yo...",

    "textPlain": "I posted similar about UK waters the other day - it isn't as extreme here but it is noticeable, on Wednesday I completed a 2+ hour snorkel (with a wetsuit) when I'm often too cold after an hour.Last night I snorkelled for 30 minutes with my son at 6pm without a wetsuit for either of us - the sea is that much warmer than average right now.The heat is impacting the local catch of lobster and crabs, and increasing the number of new fish species here - and of jelly fish.",
