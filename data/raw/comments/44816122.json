I once asked someone at MS about this, and they said they take their cues from other sources, like what industry partners ask them to fix at conferences.What a waste of time to have uservoice pages, induce people to post/vote on them, and then just ignore them. I guess it's for the best that they nuked them. They were replaced with pages that said \"tweet us\". Maybe they have something more robust now, especially since twitter is politically charged/divisive.",

Lots of terrible low grade problem reports with 59 \"me too!\"s and a poor agent typing a scripted response that was only tangentially related to the issue. Frankly, a bot trained on reddit and SO would comfortably replace the majority of answers. This is not the Raymond Chen level of problem solving we are talking about.",
