    "textPlain": "I appreciate your intent, But...This does nothing to alleviate my privacy concerns, as a bystander, about someone rudely pointing a recording camera at me.  The only thing that alleviates these concerns about \"smart\" glasses wearers recording video, is not having \"smart\" glasses wearers.  I.e., not having people rudely walking around with cameras strapped to their faces recording everyone and everything around them.  I can't know/trust that there is some tech behind the camera that will protect my privacy.A lot of privacy invasions have become normalized and accepted by the majority of the population.  But, I think/hope a camera strapped to someone's face being shoved into other peoples' faces will be a tough sell.  Google Glass wearers risked having the camera ripped off their faces / being punched in the face.  I expect this will continue.Perhaps your tech would have use in a more controlled business/military environment?  Or, to post-process police body camera footage, to remove images of bystanders before public release?",

    "textPlain": "Real-time self privacy protection people might buy into. They can trust what they are doing and they get the benefit. E.g. automatically not recording during certain periods without having to explicitly signal it each time is a convenience. I don't want my big post Taco Bell Shit to waste my storage or accidentally stream it somewhere. At the same time, I also don't want my smart glasses to be tethered to something which can run AI and video processing models all the time, or to be dumping it all to the cloud 24/7 live either, as battery is already one of the big problems with the tech currently. At least that's something the advance of technology in general may be able to solve though, so I like the concept for self-application.I don't know this would actually make others any more comfortable/guaranteed, which is where the bulk of the privacy concerns around smart glasse lie. I'm also not sure if that's actually a problem for more technology to be able to solve. The nice thing about e.g. recording consent is you do it on your device, or in some cloud device by a 3rd party. The moment you do it through the other person's device it's no different (from a trust/easiness/guarantee factor) than just asking the person themselves to not record you (again, beyond the benefits to the operator themselves around that). If some guy walked up to you with a literal video camera pointed at you and said \"it only records your face if you give it consent\":- Do you even trust the person is telling the truth?- If you do, do you trust the technology to work 100% of the time?- If it is a lie or doesn't work and they post something, are you any better off than if you weren't asked for consent and said no? (note: separate this from the value to the person operating the camera, who does get value from those that say yes).- If you say no, are you really not going to feel awkward compared to not having someone recording the rest of the situation?Maybe the answer for you to all of these is \"A",
