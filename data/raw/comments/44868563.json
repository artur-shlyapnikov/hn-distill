The only thing that alleviates these concerns about \"smart\" glasses wearers recording video, is not having \"smart\" glasses wearers.  I.e., not having people rudely walking around with cameras strapped to their faces recording everyone and everything around them.  I can't know/trust that there is some tech behind the camera that will protect my privacy.A lot of privacy invasions have become normalized and accepted by the majority of the population.  But, I think/hope a camera strapped to someone's face being shoved into other peoples' faces will be a tough sell.  Google Glass wearers risked having the camera ripped off their faces / being punched in the face.  I expect this will continue.Perhaps your tech would have use in a more controlled business/military environment?  Or, to post-process police body camera footage, to remove images of bystanders before public release?",

    "textPlain": "Real-time self privacy protection people might buy into. They can trust what they are doing and they get the benefit. E.g. automatically not recording during certain periods without having to explicitly signal it each time is a convenience. I don't want my big post Taco Bell Shit to waste my storage or accidentally stream it somewhere. At the same time, I also don't want my smart glasses to be tethered to something which can run AI and video processing models all the time, or to be dumping it all to the cloud 24/7 live either, as battery is already one of the big problems with the tech currently. At least that's something the advance of technology in general may be able to solve though, so I like the concept for self-application.I don't know this would actually make others any more comfortable/guaranteed, which is where the bulk of the privacy concerns around smart glasse lie. I'm also not sure if that's actually a problem for more technology to be able to solve. The nice thing about e.g. recording consent is you do it on your device, or in some cloud device by a 3rd party. The moment you do it through the other person's device it's no different (from a trust/easiness/guarantee factor) than just asking the person themselves to not record you (again, beyond the benefits to the operator themselves around that). If some guy walked up to you with a literal video camera pointed at you and said \"it only records your face if you give it consent\":- Do you even trust the person is telling the truth?- If you do, do you trust the technology to work 100% of the time?- If it is a lie or doesn't work and they post something, are you any better off than if you weren't asked for consent and said no? (note: separate this from the value to the person operating the camera, who does get value from those that say yes).- If you say no, are you really not going to feel awkward compared to not having someone recording the rest of the situation?Maybe the answer for you to all of these is \"A",

Just with their phone apps and OS control with a video like the displayed those companies could know exactly who each person in the video is, what are they doing, who they are with, and record that information forever.In the video I see three young women, another woman near the zebra crossing. A young woman with a young man, a woman walking with two men on the sides, and another young couple. I know their heights, if they are fat or slim, the type of their hair and so an AI could know that and with that information and a little more like someone of one group having location activated it is enough for a computer to automatically decode the remaining information.If enough people wear those stupid glasses it means in a city everyone is surveilled on real time with second and centimetre accuracy, included indoors in places like restaurants or malls.This is too much power that no company or institution should have. If Meta or google have the ability to do that, they will be required by the US government to give that info automatically with some excuse like \"national security\".",
