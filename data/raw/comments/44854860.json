    "textPlain": "> MCP thinks it's for giving context to AI models. But really? It's just a really good protocol for making things talk to other things.MCP has very little utility outside of LLMs. The article begins by saying \"but what if we remove the AI\", then goes back on that thesis by saying \"but if there was an AI between these things, then it becomes a universal plugin system\". Which is true, but its missing the critical bit: The AI itself is the universal plugin system, not MCP. And, beyond that, its not even the AI: Its natural language. Language is the universal plugin system.Its not unbelievable that there exists an alternate reality where the Anthropic researchers that invented MCP instead simply leveraged a slightly extended form of OpenAPI specs. The only functional difference is that MCP was a stdin/stdout format first, and added HTTPS later, but sister problems in this domain like LSP just skipped stdin/stdout and went straight to locally-hosted HTTPS anyway. What matters isn't MCP, OpenAPI, or anything like that; what matters is the LLM itself, its tool calling capability, and the tool calling harness. The catalogue of available tools can be in any format; and, truly, the LLM does not care what format its in.",

This seems like a generally good thing that will enhance automation. Does it really matter if the automation comes from agents, hard coded software or a combination of the two?",

Why would we serve them like that?)Also doesn't really seem to relate to the OP beside the term 'MCP' in the title",
