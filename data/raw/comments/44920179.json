    "textPlain": "The article seems to roughly match the headline - I don't know why we're sourcing the WSJ to comment on Europe's policy with ideas like \"emergency\" or \"wake up call\"s. The Europeans are the ones with the opinions that matter on this one, presumably they think this is all acceptable given that they've been heading in this direction for a decade (if not decades), cheerfully willing to bear the consequences of being less business-friendly than the States (to say nothing of China). I'm not even sure we can call this unintended consequences - there seems to be some acceptance that Europe is going to be #3 when it comes to raw economic power.I can make a forecast - anyone outside the US who lets their policy positions be swayed by the US press is heading for a disaster. Even if the Americans turn out to be accurate in their opinions. Countries need to maintain their own internal dialogue.It'd be more interesting to be looking at what the British, or even the Germans and French think about the situation. They're the ones with the levers.",

The US market is propped up on hyped big tech investments with little chance of ROI for shareholders other than inflating the valuations. PE ratio is quite frankly bananas too.At some point it’s going to be absolute carnage. Private investment companies have already seen the end game and from direct observation have been pushing the hype to drive volume so they can shift their holdings on to the bagholders.Good luck.

Of course, not much power is derived through American ownership of the means of production via the stock market because that power is delegated to the institutions who have the actual control, serving the same role as the politburo, for instance, in more ostensibly communist systems.",

The people of the US own the means of production because they can legally start their own companies, with relatively low barriers to entry, to replace the ones currently in power.The US has far more protectionism and other barriers to entry than it did when it seized the means of production from England, through the Boston tea party and the revolution that followed, but it still has enough freedom of business that it easily beats the European Union in pretty much every developing field.Where the American Revolution differes from communist reviolutions is that, after seizing the means of production from a repressive government, the revolutionaries' new government did not hold onto the means of production through a planned economy, but instead held effectively zero economic oversight, leaving production open to a free market and anyone who wished to participate in it.",

Citizens can't be trusted to make good decisions, so they only receive part of their salary, and the rest is being managed \"for them\" - and that's non-negotiable (but there are some exceptions).
