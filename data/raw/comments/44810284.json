    "textPlain": "Reminds me of how facebook used to render html snippets on the backend and the frontend would just fetch that and update the DOM.When you say it can replace htmx (which I’m using at the moment):Isn’t this similar to htmx?Like if I’m already using htmx, do I see benefits from switching?Please correct me, but I’d rather frame HMPL, htmx and Alpine.js in the same camp?So they are direct competitors and different flavors for the lightweight frontend approach.But the main proposal of HMPL et al is to make people re-think if they need a huge and complex heavy frontend approach or if/when they should go for something lighter.",
