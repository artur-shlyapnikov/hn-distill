    "textPlain": "These are the same categories of coordination I've been looking at all day, trying to find the sweet spot in how complex the orchestration can be. I tried to add some context where the agents got it into a cycle of editing the code that another was testing and stuff like that.I know my next step should be to give the agents a good git pattern but I'm having so much fun just finding the team organization that delivers better stuff. I have them consult with each other in tech choices and have picked what I would have pickedThe consensus protocol for choices is one I really liked, and that will maybe do more self correction.Ive been asking them to illustrate their flow of work and asking for decisions, I need to go back and see if that's the case. Probably would be made easier if I get my git experiment flow down.The future is tooling for these. If we can team up enough that we get consensus approaching something 'safe' the tools we can give them to run in dry/live mode and have a human validate the process for a time and then once you have enough feedback move into the next thing needing fixing.I have a lot of apps with cobra cli tooling that resides next to the server code. Being able to pump our docs into an mcp server for tool execution is giving me so many ideas.",
