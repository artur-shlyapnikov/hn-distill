[NB: Where kentonv works to this day, leading the Cloud Workers team. Arguably related?] [...]> In 2020, a group of Sandstorm enthusiasts began a community effort to revive development of Sandstorm. [...] As of 2022, Sandstorm Development Group has been completely dissolved, and development of the Sandstorm project has transitioned to a community-run model.kentonv actually posted a recap of the history, including the tragic passing of Ian \"zenhack\" Denhart who was leading the community effort https://sandstorm.io/news/2024-01-14-move-to-sandstorm-org",

    "textPlain": "Hello everyone. I have been using Sandstorm and put it to good use in the last few years.I used it with Wekan for project management and I also run Dokuwiki for self-hosted docs. It has been zero maintenance for me so it has been great.However, the packages ecosystem seems unmaintained. It is a pitty because I think the tool has a ton of potential and I really liked it.I am considering moving to Yunohost or something similar but right now my little server hosts, together with other services, Sandstorm and I think Yunohost needs to monopolize the server.So I would ask for recommendations on similar tools. Not bare Docker containers but fully lanaged platforms wirh one click installs where it is easy to add/remove users.",

Sadly though it’s hard to justify time investment into a platform like this if you know there’s little to no chance of getting any issues fixed.",
