    "textPlain": "In China in the year 2025, cooking pre-cooked package in a microwave in a restaurant is now an industry norm.  ex.1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh2_Fj5-m7c.  ex.2: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Tp-DfNqDXuo.  implications of this are:1.) customers who don't know about the practice, now expect food right away for very cheap price, which bankrupts traditional restaurants that cook from fresh ingredients.  An analogy could be off the shelf software or custom software losing sales to vibe coded software2.) customers who do know about the practice, stops ordering food altogether, due to food issues (prepared ingredients are very low quality, oil could be very dirty) or they could cook prepared food at home in their own microwave for even cheaper.  An analogy is programmers coding their own software using vibe coding.3.) declining quality of food, and less and less people eating out in China.  It's gotten so bad that now hotel restaurants, which would be the fine dining options, are setting up food stalls in the street to sell cheap but freshly cooked food, in order to get people into the hotel restaurants.  An analogy might be softwares with per seat pricing changing to action based pricing for an initial period.",

But there will still be a use for steam-jacketed kettles and fryers.I think LLM is here to stay but cheap output won't have value.  We're rapidly tired if its flooding of the zone with spam.  The microwave killed some traditional ways of cooking, and the LLM is killing some older ways of communicating.  Not because it's better, but because it makes e-mail tiresome.",

    "textPlain": "Almost all the cooking I do are using microwave. While they are not bad, there are certain critical steps microwave cannot do. For example enrich the flavor of garlic and other spices in hot cooking oil. I found microwave is not good at heating vegetable oil and the garlic is more like boiling in lukewarm oil instead of frying. Also it heats food inside out equally as compared to stove which transmit heat from the out layer to inside, as result the food have different textures.",

I hear whole cities will be designed around them.",
