    "textPlain": "This is interesting but, speaking frankly, I see many seemingly insurmountable issues. Here are some:- Contests will often be won not by the entry that best adhered to the prompt, but the best-looking one. This happened in the contest \"Input Prompt\nBuild a brutalist website to a typeface maker,\" which I got as a recent example. The winning entry had megawatt-bright magenta and yellow, which shouldn't appear anywhere near brutalism, and in other design aspects had almost no connection to brutalism either -- but it was the most attractive of the bunch.- The approach only gets you to a local maximum. Current LLMs aren't very good designers, as you say, so contests will involve picking between mostly middling entries. You'd want a design that's, say, a 9 or a 10 on a 10-point scale -- but some 95% of the entry distribution will probably be between 5.5 and 7.5 or so, and that's what users will get to pick from.",

    "textPlain": "All great points. A limitation with human feedback is that once you start asking for more than binary preferences (e.g. multiple rankings or written feedback), the quality of the feedback does decrease. For instance, many times humans can give a quick answer on preference, but when asked \"why\" they prefer one thing over the other, they might not be able to full explain it in language. This in general is very much an open area of research on collecting and incorporating the most optimal types of feedback.I definitely agree with your second point. One idea we're experimenting with is adding a human baseline, in which the models are benchmarked against human generated designs as well.",

With text output that ended up being extensive markdown and emojis.

There should be asteroids flying and 2 ships being controlled by 2 computers. Pay attention to thoroughly implementing the logic to make the ships avoid asteroids at all costs. Absolutely no user input should be necessary, no click to start, no click to restart. The game starts automatically on load and automatically restarts when either computer is dead. The ships should survive as long as possible. The ships should fly around, avoid asteroids as a priority, but also shoot asteroids and each other. Make ships and asteroids positions random each time. Asteroids should split when shot. The goal is to create a robust algorithm for ships so they can survive as long as possible. The game should be playable at 500x500 screen resolution.",
