    "textPlain": "I work with Nix a lot, and I had never seen `__findFile`.It's kind of crazy how much there is to know about Nix. I wish there was a bit less surface area to the language. On the other hand it's really interesting how much specialized knowledge there is in the community around various topics. Some people package things,  some people write library code, some write glue code that wraps other build tools, some write VM-based tests, some write generators that transform store paths into things like container images, some just manage their dot files, some are experts for how we deal with some specific proprietary ecosystem like cuda, some write infra code or tools around the Nix code, some work on one of the Nix implementations.",
