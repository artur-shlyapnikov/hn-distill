See KB1011: https://tailscale.com/kb/1011/log-mesh-traffic“Each Tailscale agent in your distributed network streams its logs to a central log server (at log.tailscale.io). This includes real-time events for open and close events for every inter-machine connection (TCP or UDP) on your network.”It's possible to opt out of this spying on Unix/Windows/Mac clients by starting Tailscale with `--no-logs-no-support` or `TS_NO_LOGS_NO_SUPPORT=true` environment variable (see https://tailscale.com/kb/1011/log-mesh-traffic#opting-out-of...), but it is not currently possible to opt out in the Android/iOS clients: https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/13174For an example of how invasive this is for the average user, this person discovered Tailscale trying to collect ~18000 data points per week about their network usage based on the number of blocked DNS requests for `log.tailscale.com`: https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/15326Also see their privacy policy: https://tailscale.com/privacy-policy#information-we-collect-...“When you use the Tailscale Solution, we collect limited metadata regarding your device used to access the Tailscale Solution, such as: the device name; relevant operating system type; host name; IP address; cryptographic public key; user agent (where applicable); language settings; date and time of access to the Tailscale Solution; logs describing connections and containing statistics about data sent to and from other devices (“Inter-Node Traffic Logs”); and version of the Tailscale Solution installed.” (emphasis mine)Anyway, the reason I quoted that part of your post is because Tailscale are using some Fear, Uncertainty",

But we made an intentional choice from day one that we weren't going to try to be an anonymity tool. Quite the opposite in fact! We're an identity-centric network.Anonymity tools, like Tor, need to be architected very differently. They trade away speed to reduce traceability. They are hard to inspect and diagnose and debug, as a feature. They make enemies, both political and corporate. They are inherently hard to audit and control, by design. In short, they are the exact opposite of what you want your corporate (or even homelab) network to be.We believe anonymity tools are essential to safe network infrastructure and a free society. But, those tools are made by other people.…But if you’re looking for complete anonymity online, Tailscale is not the tool for you. Y'all, we're an identity-centric network with a centralized control plane. You should assume law enforcement can easily find out that you use Tailscale. Tailscale packets are pretty easy to detect, so you can assume they could know, through ISP logs, the shape and size of data you send between different nodes in different places (albeit without knowing the decrypted packet contents). You should assume they can correlate that flow metadata with your login identity.",

You've usually got at least some minimal audit requirement on any network with high value stuff on it.It's probably not great that someone trying to use the free sample product lands in the same netlogging regime as the work network default, but I suspect thats more about allocation of attention and priority which understandably goes to the companies that make up approximately all of their business. Keeping the free sample product around after its long bern clear \"this is for work computers\" is just one of those things. The \"no support\" suffix on a setting is not to me the smoking gun you make it out to be, and I'm pretty hardcore in my attitudes about surveilance.I agree it's the wrong default for a purely personal user, but TailScale has enough \"good faith actor\" points with me that I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on malicious/evil dragnet surveilance ambitions. What could they possibly want with the data of a group of people who are by construction not spending money on a VPN? They'd be storing it at a loss.",
