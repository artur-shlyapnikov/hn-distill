Folks are just consuming the firehose and scanning.And in this case, if the thing you're funnel'ing is on your residential connection, it basically amounts to you summoning a DDoS.One (obvious?) tip I'd offer is to put your stuff on high non-standard ports if you can. It'll reduce the amount of connections you get dramatically.",

    "textPlain": "Speaking of SSH, Tailscale has special support for it whereby it handles any incoming connection to port 22 from the Tailscale network, and deals with authentication itself. No public keys or passwords: if you’re logged into Tailscale you can be logged into the machine. This is particularly handy when you SSH from a phone, as proper credential management is a bit of a nightmare there.this has me worried. i would not want that. i use zerotier, not tailscale, but the principle is the same. i have my laptops and my phone connected to my servers. given that all of those machines are already on the internet, connecting them into a virtual network does not add any risk in my opinion. (at least as long as you don't use features like the above). all i get is a known ip address for all my devices, with the ability to connect to them if they have an ssh server running. when i am outside the primary benefit is that i can tell which devices are online.",
