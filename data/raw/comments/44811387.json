    "textPlain": "If we are purely talking about textbooks, I can see the value in a tool like this... assuming we still have yet to actually solve the problem of AI being able to tell the truth and could just lead to more issues if we can't even read a textbook without it and then learn the wrong thing.Not to necessarily diss the work that was done on this, but the idea of actually wanting this for reading feels like it is a continuation of the lack of attention span that has seemed to get worse and worse. We already saw this with the oversimplification of television shows and movies. Many of them leaning more towards slapping you in the face with something instead of subtly.I know way too many people that struggle to sit still for a half hour episode of some show now (like my partner, frustratingly) and have to be doing something else.If you are struggling with absorbing the information you are reading that is likely a sign you should put down the book and come back to it later, obviously your mind wants to be doing something else. If it is a continued issue than practice reading something that you know you would like. Personally my \"in\" for my love of reading was reading video game books that expanded the lore and it grew from there, but I was already invested in the story so the book was easier to read.Using this for a book feels more like a crutch than anything else. That is obviously before you get into whether or not the LLM is actually going to tell you the truth.There is however one possible use case I could get into, but this is something that could be solved by just finding a video or something online. A refresher when it has been a long time between books coming out in a series.",

I'd then have it extract unusual vocabulary words, Latin phrases, and cultural/historical references and compare that list to my handwritten notes from my close reading session. It was fun to have a dialog with the LLM about the chapter, and I felt like I got a lot out of it.At some point I'll work on better integrating Emacs's nov.el EPUB reader with gptel to approximate something like this. Books are text, and I already have the ultimate text processing environment that I've invested quite a lot of time in.",

These people likely bell-curve around certain neurotypes, which perhaps know certain sorts of knowledge more strongly.Right now, those people shouldn't publish. But if LLMs could augment poorly structured content (not incorrect content, just poorly structured), that perhaps open up more people to share their wisdom.Anyhow, just thinking out loud here.

    "textPlain": "Sounds like a cool project.  Not sure if it's one that I would personally use, but I think that LLMs can be used wisely.What I've found interesting when doing similar experiments (feeding things like books to an LLM and asking questions) is that the output is almost always more bland than one would hope for.  I suspect this may both be a result of LLMs being biased for the material they've been trained on and a reality I've suspected which is that the majority of books are mostly filler and aren't making points that are particularly profound.  Most books, when you distill them down, fundamentally communicate ideas that are rather obvious, but the language around those points makes them sound a lot more profound than they really are.  It's a kind of hypnosis, I think.  In a sense, LLMs may be able to reveal how bereft a piece of written material is.I disagree with the OP's statement that traditional e-readers being passive is actually a \"problem\".  It's kind of like saying that cars are a problem because they can't fly.  Maybe I'm being pedantic, but being alone with a book and one's own thoughts is hardly a problem; if anything, the problem is fewer and fewer people are comfortable without a constant barrage of thoughts other than their own.",

When I pick up the latest volume, sometimes there are details that I just can't remember (small details that may turn out important, relationships between minor characters, etc.)I would just consult a fan wiki, but that doesn't work if the title isn't popular or if the book is too new. This seems like the perfect tool if it can somehow maintain coherency across multiple books.That said, I do understand (and share) a lot of the frustration and hesitancy that people here have around AI tools; I don't want an app that takes away the act of thinking (like that post recently about teachers using AI to make banal lesson plans, and students in turn using AI to write essays -- what is the point then?). I hope you don't take it too much to heart, and try to showcase use cases where your app can actually provide value.Another piece of feedback is it would be great if this could be all packaged up into a docker image that would make it easy to deploy on a local machine (or like on a home server/NAS).
