    "textPlain": "I could see this. For certain personality archetypes, there are particular topics, terms, and phrases that for whatever reason ChatGPT seems to constantly direct the dialogue flow toward: \"recursive\", \"compression\", \"universal\". I was interested in computability theory way before 2022, but I noticed that these (and similar) terms kept appearing far more often than I would expect to due chance alone, even in unrelated queries.Started searching and found news articles talking LLM-induced psychosis or forum posts about people experiencing derealization. Almost all of these articles or posts included that word: \"recursive\". I suspect those with certain personality disorders (STPD or ScPD) may be particularly susceptible to this phenomenon. Combine eccentric, unusual, or obsessive thinking with a tool that continually reflects and confirms what you're saying right back at you, and that's a recipe for disaster.",

Thinking it'd be benign I started reading it a bit, it was pretty clear the person chatting had some kind of mental disorder such as schizophrenia. It was a bit scary to see how the responses from chatgpt encouraged and furthered delusions, feeding into their theories and helping them spiral further. The thread was hundreds of messages long and it just went deeper and deeper. This was a situation I hadn't thought of, but given the sycophantic nature of some of these models, it's inevitable that they'll lead people further towards some dangerous tendencies or delusions.",
