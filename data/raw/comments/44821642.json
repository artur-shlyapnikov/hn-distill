I remember it never worked properly, but being able to access MS-DOS and program in GW-BASIC was amazing to me.  At least I could convice my parents at the time that I would use the computer not only for gaming but for also for school homework ( we had a class for learning programming/informatics )[0]: https://dfarq.homeip.net/amiga-bridgeboard-the-pc-compatibil...",

As a kid I spent nights doing stuff with my Amiga 2000, trying to develop animations in Aztec C compiler, writing my own (super inefficient) matrix library, hacking assembler, playing games, it was just unbelievably cool. There were Atari guys and Amiga guys in my hood. And we‘d have endless discussions about which was better. Defining moments. An Apple computer was not affordable in Germany. And my Amiga 2000 must have cost 2000 Deutsch Marks back then.",

It was entirely a practical matter - the OS was pretty buggy and Commodore knew it. It was smarter to distribute the firmware/OS on magnetic media vs burning it in forever.The hard drive story may have been weird, but it was very flexible.You could in theory design completely new storage hardware today and hook it up to an old Amiga, and the operating system would be just fine because the drivers can be loaded from the device itself.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconfig",
