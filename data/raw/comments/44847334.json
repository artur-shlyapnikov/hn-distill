    "textPlain": "This article feels extremely imprecise. The syntax of the \"language\" changes from example to example, control structures like conditionals are expressed in English prose, some examples are solved by \"do all the work for me\" functions like the \"toPdf()\" example...This whole thing feels like an elaborate LLM fantasy. Is there any real, usable language behind these examples, or is the author just role-playing with ChatGPT?",

    "textPlain": "I know ACM Queue is a non-peer-reviewed magazine for practitioners but this still feels like too much of an advertisement, without any attempt whatsoever to discuss downsides or limitations. This really doesn't inspire confidence:  While this may seem like a whimsical example, it is not intrinsically easier or harder for an AI model compared to solving a real-world problem from a human perspective. The model processes both simple and complex problems using the same underlying mechanism. To lessen the cognitive load for the human reader, however, we will stick to simple targeted examples in this article.\n\nFor LLMs this is blatantly false - in fact asking about \"used textbooks\" instead of \"apples\" is measurably more likely to result in an error! Maybe the (deterministic, Prolog-style) Universalis language mitigates this. But since Automind (an LLM, I think) is responsible for pre/post validation, naively I would expect it to sometimes output incorrect Universalis code and incorrectly claim an assertion holds when it does not.Maybe I am making a mountain out of a molehill but this bit about \"lessen the cognitive load of the human reader\" is kind of obnoxious. Show me how this handles a slightly nontrivial problem, don't assume I'm too stupid to understand it by trying to impress me with the happy path.",
