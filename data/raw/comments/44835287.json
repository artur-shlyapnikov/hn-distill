Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.The previous report (from 2013) only said (and much further in)Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system.The equivalent statement from AR4 (2007) wasThe understanding of anthropogenic warming and cooling influences on climate has improved since the TAR, leading to very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming,  ...You could argue there is more of a question about what to do about it (e.g. try and mitigate climate change or just pay for the damanges).
