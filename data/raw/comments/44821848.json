Brings back so many memories.For \"newer\" folk, who are interested, you should try to get your hands on a copy of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Lamp and watch it. It covers the history of the games and everything else. Everyone relevant is interviewed with the notable exception of Graham Nelson (author of the Inform language). The tag line sums it up pretty well - \"before the first person shooter, there was the second person thinker.\"Plotkin himself is a bit of a heavyweight in the IF world. I'm not surprised that this was by him.I tinkered with the language and environment a little. Inform 7, with it's natural language style of writing, is a fascinating environment.",

Going off of the flavour of the second challenge, which isDefine values for cat and dog so that cat and dog are equal? but not eqv?. Furthermore, cdr(cat) and cdr(dog) must be eqv?.One is assumed to know the difference between equal? and eqv? and the challenge is in coming up with data that satisfies the constraints given.",

I guarantee you that you will be astonished by this amazing leap in technology.More seriously though, Lists and Lists is a concept game from 1996 based upon the text adventure games that were popular in the 1980's. It implements a subset of Scheme for the z-machine, which was an early virtual machine in the JVM sense of a virtual machine (both from a technical perspective, and the \"write once, run anywhere\" perspective). While it's ability to interpret language was quite limited, it was certainly sufficient for exploring complex virtual worlds.",
