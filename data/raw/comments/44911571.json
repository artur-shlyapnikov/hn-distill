    "textPlain": "I use a TENS unit with an almost identical setup to the paper (ear clip is the same, duration is the same, frequency is 30hz instead of 25hz).My use of vagus stimulation is for managing anxiety and promoting digestion / gut motility. I have neck issues that probably impinge on this nerve, contributing to these symptoms. Evidence suggests that the effect isn't purely psychosomatic; when laying on my back with TENS, I observe an increased frequency of GI tract \"gurgles\" relative to off. The observable product of my GI tract has also normalized somewhat.",

The fact that vagus nerve stimulation improves VO2Max in healthy volunteers is a nice proof of concept for a treatment that could then be tried in sicker populations.",

    "textPlain": "20th century Czech runner Emil Zatopek practiced, among other things, interval training with held breath. He could have been training his parasympathetic system just as well as respiration pathways.It's been my experience in endurance exercise is that if you are inexperienced in it, you overreact to certain signals from your body like rising CO2 or falling O2. After just small effort of a short duration you start gasping for air. Years later, in retrospect, you wonder why you did that.Another adaptation, in high latitude outdoor runners, is the adaptation to inhaling cold, wintry air. The unbearable burning that feels like you're inhaling alcohol somehow goes away. The interesting thing is that it appears to be permanent. Even if you're out of the game for few years, that discomfort doesn't come back. Could be psychological. If you've been there and done that, you dismiss the discomfort signals and don't pay attention to them.",
