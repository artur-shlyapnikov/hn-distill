Pretty crazy to see this after reading OpenAI is giving each employee a $1.5M bonus. 99% of that money will go into real estate and the stock market, leaving open source like Perl / Raku scraping by with $11k from SUSE, who call it \"a fundamental component\". Building a fundamental technology gets you scraps, but riding on the hype train that's causing more problems than it solves gets you flush with cash.And then people wonder why programming languages only come from big corporations these days.",
