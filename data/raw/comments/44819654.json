    "textPlain": "Here's a summary of similar moves in Florida:https://medium.com/@edmondthorne/floridas-big-utilities-quie...> Florida’s Big Utilities Quiet & Strategic Campaign to Limit Consumer Rooftop Solar> Investor-owned utilities in Florida have quietly waged a multi-pronged campaign to limit rooftop solar adoption, using legislation, lobbying, and public messaging to preserve their market dominance, as well as a few untruths here and there.Interestingly, after they got legislation passed the Governor there veto'd it due to popular support for home solar.America generally has much higher costs for home solar which is likely in part due to lobbying like this makeing it hard to streamline the industry by removing red tape.",

    "textPlain": "Something I don't see mentioned in the article is the obvious hypocrisy and lack of accountability for making bad decisions. If solar is so bad for prices which affect poor people, then doesn't it follow that the government shouldn't be as aggerssive with other \"green\" policies? Wouldn't this be the same outcome if everyone starts switching to electric cars? If this is not corruption it is unprecedented levels of incompetence. Unfortunately Californians don't seem to pay attention while the ones that are paying attention are leaving. I fear it's already in a doom loop.",

Big state, diverse state, big infrastructure, big demand surges, huge investments, etc. There are lawsuits over NME 3, so we can hope for a better result through compromise.  Lots of sunshine + cheaper solar panels = future with lots of solar power.  It's unavoidable.",
