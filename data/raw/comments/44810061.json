Firefox on mobile with full-fat uBlock Origin is the closest thing to parity with desktop web access you can get.I don't just block ads, I block elements on sites I don't care about with :has-text RegEx rules.  You can't do that on Chrome even on desktop anymore.I'm this close to swapping to the Android as my primary device-- it's iMessage that has me chained.  It's just too dang nice to respond to chats from my Mac during work so I don't need to pick up my phone.Everything else is better on the Android.  Don't get me started about the iOS keyboard or Siri.",

The system would be so much better to develop for if XPC was an open API, and JIT for isolated sub-processes was permitted without Apple's blessing.* Messengers could have separate sub-processes for preprocessing untrusted inputs -- iMessage already does this, third-party messengers are single-process and cannot.* Applications could isolate unstable components for better user experience and crash recovery.* Emulators, e.g. for retro systems, would benefit from speedy emulation.* WASM would become useful in iOS.* Browser could use XPC without special-purpose API wrappers such as BrowserEngineKit.But alas, all of this would make it easier to load code that runs at native speed into an iOS app after a store review happened, and as we all know that'll be the end of the world.",

Even if you completely exclude obvious benefits, like being able to support more APIs than Safari, it forces Apple to actually compete with other browsers and implement things if they start getting real market share.Not that you really should, but Safari has a limit of 500 tabs. Why? It's arbitrary. Safari doesn't support WebRequest in blocking mode, so you can't have real adblockers (just MV3 style content blockers, like uBOL). There are all sorts of edge cases too, like if you want cross-browser sync and extensions. Sure, you can totally run Safari with extension support, but extensions in e.g., Orion are shaky at best.The biggest claim that Apple made about this whole thing was that web browsers offered an attack surface increase as a result of giving JIT to other browsers, and they could be owned. Frankly, though, I would take a browser without JIT if I had a real adblocker.",
