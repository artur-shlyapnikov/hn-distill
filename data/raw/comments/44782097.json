    "textPlain": "‘Berény is likely to have painted Sleeping Lady with Black Vase from 1927 to 1928, by which time he had returned to Budapest, in his native Hungary, from Berlin where he had fled following World War I.The painting was last seen in public in 1928 when it exhibited at the Ernst Museum before being sold.The buyer is likely to have been Jewish and left the country in the lead up to or during World War II. Hungary was turbulent during this period and the painting was considered lost’. Sad to see a painting with such history ending up in a private collection, also considering that its some of Bereny’s best work too",
