That sounds so weird but familiar.I bought a Dutch coin operated phone a long time ago, mounted it to the wall in a student apartment complex and set up a cheap VoIP account.The best feature was that it is possible to call to the phone as well. Very useful if you needed _someone_ who was at home.",

    "textPlain": "Interesting that people are asking for one of his phones. presumably because he would be providing the service for free(to them not to him). as if the idea of paying for a voip service of their own is totally impossible and would break the bank. Its like people have completely forgotten that you can still have a land line, and its never been cheaper.",
