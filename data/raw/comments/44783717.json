    "textPlain": "Here's a complimentary article from Bill Yeager's perspective: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407787> I asked Len why he wanted my\nsource code, and he told me that facilities wanted to take over the\nrouter/EtherTIP’s development because\nI couldn’t dedicate myself to full-time\nsupport of the system I had invented\nand developed with help from Mike\nand Benjy over the past five years. This\nrequest seemed reasonable to me, so I\ngave him the access he requested and\nthanked him for his willingness to\nmaintain and improve the software.\nI didn’t know that Len and Sandy\nLerner had incorporated Cisco Systems\na year earlier or that Len might have\nhad an ulterior motive: to do a rewrite\nand then copyright the sources as\nCisco Systems’ intellectual property.> I learned about Cisco a year later\nwhen I was called into Stanford’s legal\ndepartment and told to bring a hard\ncopy of my sources. Needless to say, I\nwas a little nervous. Upon arrival, I\nwas greeted by Stanford lawyer Iris\nBrest, who explained Cisco’s existence\nand Len, Sandy, and Kirk’s involvement. She then asked me to compare\nthe Sumex-AIM sources with the EE\nsources that Kirk had written and tell\nher if I thought the work was derivative. Most of the EE sources could best\nhave been described as plagiarized or\nparaphrased: variable names were\nchanged, subroutines were renamed,\nand large data structures were broken\ninto smaller ones, but identical parts\nabounded throughout the code. Kirk\nhad added new features and removed\nothers, but the “derivation” was obvious even to Iris who, from what I could\ntell, didn’t have a technical background. She thanked me, kept my\nsources, and sent me on my way.> Just to be clear, I didn’t object to the\nformation of Cisco Systems or its use\nof the code I had invented — in fact, I\nwas pleased that work of which I was\nextremely proud could be used in this\nmanner. However, I did object to the\ntheft of intellectual property implicit in\nCisco’s copyright on the sources.",

    "textPlain": "I worked at Cisco 1999-2001, it was my first job out of school.  I worked in a group that did network management software, so we weren't touching iOS.But it was kind of wild at that point there were still company mailing lists where these old heads would argue about iOS internals and flame each other in front of the whole company.We still had a non-web bug tracking system while I was there.   It was an interesting era!   The product I worked on did have a web interface as essentially its only UI.   We used Java, at some point we used MS Visual J++, and this was before JSPs existed.   We used some proprietary templating engine to generate HTML.",

    "textPlain": "At Stanford in a non-academic IT department, not long after this was published, we had to beg for departmental firewalls to protect laptops, desktops, and \"servers\" (but not so much for proper servers). Every machine was essentially on the upper-cased then Internet with a globally-routable IPv4 with almost no Layer 2 IP ACLs. That didn't work so well with negligently-vulnerable Microsoft OS and software. The plus side was that Cisco gear was the standard networking stuff and relatively low cost for hardware and feature packs. Curiously, the housing draw (lottery) was run on a BSD box. About half of the department ran on top of FileMaker Pro (FMP), which ran on Xserves. It was the Windows 2000 and XP/2003 Server machines that were the biggest pains.",

    "textPlain": "In case people are suspicious/wondering about this story, it is credible to me. I worked with Bill Yundt and he told the story back in 1996. I've also seen the absolute lowest layers of Cisco IOS for 68000's and it certainly appears to come from that era of computing. One especially surprising and interesting thing to me is that it uses cooperative multitasking, not preemptive. This is how systems were written in those days, based on the limitations of early microprocessors. (At the same time in the industry, protected mode multiprocessing existed. But it was in big iron, controlled by IBM, Cray, Unisys and CDC. And those are all of the has-beens now: because technologies like microprocessors, even with their limitations, took over the industry.)",
