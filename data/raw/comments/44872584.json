    "textPlain": "I get as exasperated at C++ as anyone else, but IMO there's another takeaway here, which is that smart contracts are an absolutely terrible idea. Relying on code as the source of truth for a transaction just completely disregards the reality that code is always going to be buggy. For those who might not be aware, this is the same smart contract framework where someone accidentally killed $300 million of transactions because a function in a library for setting the wallet associated with a private key was defined as public instead of private: https://medium.com/cybermiles/i-accidentally-killed-it-and-e...Yes, you can fix issues like this with a \"hard fork\" if you have a large enough consensus, but at that point, does the system of having smart contracts actually improve anything over the one where the software is downstream rather than the source of truth, or are you just replacing one form of \"human intervention required\" with a different but worse one?",
