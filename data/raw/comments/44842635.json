    "textPlain": "My understanding was that with GPT-5 you don't actually get the high quality stuff unless the system decides that you need it. So, for simple questions you end up getting the subpar response. A bit like not getting hot water until you increase the flow enough to trigger the boiler to start the heating.Lately I enjoy Grok the most for simple questions, even if it isn't necessarily about a recent event. Then I like OpenAI, Mistral, Deepseek equally and for some reason never felt good about Gemini. Tried switching to Gemini Pro the last two months but I found myslef going back to ChatGPT's free mode and Grok's free mode. Cancelled yesterday and now happily back to ChatGPT Plus.I got %80 GPT-5 preference anyway.",
