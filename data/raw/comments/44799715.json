The timing of the Python 2 -> 3 transition and the debacle that especially ensued as the various Linux distros made a particular dog's breakfast out of some of it also created additional or new Anti-Python sentiment among would be source control users.",

    "textPlain": "I think Git was initially more popular and that had compounding effects that made it eclipse Mercurial.In 2010 or so we tried to adopt Mercurial at the small company I worked at, but the support for Git was just so much better - even back then. Git's popularity meant that tooling, documentation, and general ease of finding people to ask questions was 100x easier with Git, so we switched. I'd imagine the same thing played out many times over.A few FAANGs did and still use Mercurial, but they're on their own islands and don't really affect the wider tech ecosystem.",

That was the mail in Mercurial's coffin. Google also decided to shut down their Google Code.Git's appeal is that it is more flexible and has every feature you might want, allowing people to do whatever they wish whether it's pretty or not. As long as it works, people can look past the ergonomics. GUIs and AI shield most people from the UI.",

Mercurial felt so alien when I was using it. Git has its own share of UX problems, but finding support for Mercurial was much harder for me, precisely because nobody really uses it anymore.References:0: https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/1: https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/firefox-dev/c/Qnfy...",

    "textPlain": "Mercurial didn’t have the evangelical base that GitHub gave git. Mercurial was hard to see in the real world. Mercurial was not taken up by the young programmers. Soon enough fewer young programmers meant more expensive development time because older more experienced programmers would be maintaining the code.But I think the biggest reason mercurial did not do well was because the viral network was not there.If hg wants to still be relevant, it should copy all of git’s commands and features and then supplement it with native features.",

And the how many uses this vs. how many use that numbers were not so unequal. Tossup IIRC. But GitHub made Git easy to use as a team, collaborative and social, whereas Bitbucket made it easier but not with the same enthusiasm . Small advantages in user base size, branding, and ease of being supported \"in the cloud\" compounded over time, until suddenly using Mercurial seemed unusual and off the beaten path yet using Git felt natural and common. When supporting services (like CI/CD services) grew, it was clear who'd they support first. The market leader, natch. And so the momentum grew. Classic VHS vs Betamax.",

Beginners don't have the experience to make informed decisions about ergonomics and other nuances. More or less the features of git vs mercurial don't matter when a person adopts source control for the first time.3. Ecosystems trump ergonomics...e.g. github. So does branding...i.e. the software Torvaldes wrote. And if I could make a bet, I'd bet Torvaldes writes software about as good as anyone on the Mercurial team, if not better.",
