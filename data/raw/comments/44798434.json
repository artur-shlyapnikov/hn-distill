    "textPlain": "When someone posts on forums and social media, IME it's very common that the replies focus on how they can \"make OP wrong\". They only seem to care about how OP can be interpreted as ignorant or illogical or immoral, rather than insightful or helpful. I am sure I'm as guilty of this as anyone else.It would be good if we understood this phenomenon better, why we do it and how we can be more balanced in our approach to what others say online.",

    "textPlain": "This reminds me of one of my favourite exchanges in a detective story:'Dear me!' said Miss de Vine, 'who is that very uninspired young woman? She seems very much annoyed with my review of Mr. Winterlake's book on Essex. She seems to think I ought to have torn the poor man to pieces because of a trifling error of a few months made in dealing, quite incidentally, with the early history of the Bacon family. She attaches no importance to the fact that the book is the most illuminating and scholarly handling to date of the interactions of two most enigmatic characters.''Bacon family history is her subject,' said Miss Lydgate, 'so I've no doubt she feels strongly about it.''It's a great mistake to see one's own subject out of proportion to its background. The error should be corrected, of course; I did correct it--in a private letter to the author, which is the proper medium for trifling corrections. But the man has, I feel sure, got hold of the master-key to the situation between those two men, and in so doing he has got hold of a fact of genuine importance.'-- Gaudy Night, D.L.Sayers (1935)I think comment sections tend to bring out the \"feels strongly\" responses where the \"private letter\" ones would be more appropriate.While Gaudy Night is a detective story, it's just as much a love letter to Oxford academia (the author being an alumni).",

I would not have one even with the products that claim to handle that spam for you.As for the \"I thought about this problem for 10s let me tell you all the things wrong with it\" - yeah. Engineers do that. I'm constantly pointing it out in relation to LLM coding agents.Lately I've been stuck in YouTube court cases recommendations. There are live trials and many archives for all sorts of real court cases at every stage. I have grown an appreciation for what a judge does. A judge listens and makes sure all information has been provided before making a judgement/ruling/order. The patience those folks show is significant. I can only imagine how tiring that amount of active listening must be. I have found it personally inspiring and educational.",

    "textPlain": "I have also intentionally not included a comments feature on my blog.The biggest reason is to avoid extrinsic motivation. What we really miss from the early web is that people were publishing with almost purely intrinsic motivations. Nowadays almost everything on the web is extrinsically motivated, and that is the source of much of the toxicity.The second reason is a matter of principle. It’s _my_ blog. I publish things here. Why should I feel obliged to allow any rando to publish their screed right next to mine on _my_ website? If you got something to say, go publish on your own web site. If you want, email me. Maybe if I’m feeling generous I will publish a letter to the editor, like a traditional newspaper or magazine.IMO comments sections were largely a mistake. We would have been better off in a place where we didn’t take for granted that every single article published on the web would have one.",

    "textPlain": "I love having comments on my site/blog. I learn so much from some of them. For example, on my hexagon page, someone said there's a connection with \"Eisenstein integers\". I had never heard of them, and they were fun to learn about. Another example, I don't know \"doubled coordinates\" that well, so some sections of the page are incomplete. In the comments people have pointed to resources and code that fill in the gaps in my knowledge. Most recently, someone pointed out an inconsistency in something I wrote, and they were right — I have updated the page to resolve it. Before that, someone pointed to an emacs package that might make my life easier, and it looks like it will indeed partially solve the problem I had posted about.I spend almost zero time moderating, because I've outsourced it to blogger/disqus. I'm not a big fan of disqus but the comments provide so much value to me, and disqus does the moderation so well, that I keep using it for now.I think of it like giving a talk at a conference, and having questions afterwards. At some conferences, the questions are a waste of time. But at other conferences, the questions are quite valuable. I think comments don't work well on all sites. But they work well on mine.",
