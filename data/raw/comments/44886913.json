I don't mean arguments about how liberty can lead to more economic prosperity, I mean how liberty is valuable on its own terms.Without this value, the state can continue to erect legislation in the name of \"safety\", or any other perceived inequity in society, until you can no longer move.How perverse that English law used to be a bastion of civil liberty protections.

In a similar way USA&UK diverge from most EU  by not issuing national ID cards and not having central resident registries but then having powerful surveillance organizations that do that anyway just illegally(Obama apologized when they were caught).I don't say that Europeans are any better, just different approaches to achieve the same thing. The Euros just appear to be more open and more direct with it.The tech is there, the desire to have knowledge on what is going on is there and the desire to act on these to do good/bad is there and always has been like that. Now that it's much easier and feasible, my European instinct say that let's have this thing but have it openly and governed by clear rules.The American instincts appear to say that let's not have it but have it with extra steps within a business model where it can be commercialized and the government can then can have it clandestinely to do the dirty work.IMHO it is also the reason why extremist governments in US can do decade worth of work of shady things in few months and get away with it when in Europe that stuff actually takes decades and consumes the whole career of a politician to change a country in any way.Also, the Brits are usually in between of those two extremes.",
