I use it a lot because it's the only way of getting programmatic notifications from credit card purchases (turn on purchase alerts to all cards, send to Gmail, have a filter archive but capture the reception in webhooks. Parse with simple regex)Super fast low latency very satisfying. Pubsub scales well and free :)",

I'm building something that I might consider this for, but I don't know how long my runway is before I get sustainable client revenue, so $100/month is a deep hole being burned in my personal pocket before I can prove my MVP out.",
