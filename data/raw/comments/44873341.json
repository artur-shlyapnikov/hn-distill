    "textPlain": "It all depends on interest from the developer community. Many devs are rooting for forge federation for years and are waiting for it to happen. Both Forgejo [0] and ForgeFed [1] are fully community-driven free software efforts, and things go as fast as there are people stepping up to do the work.The ActivityPub-related [2] epic at Gitlab [3], which I also linked in another comment, is another example. It is a ramp up to adding support for the ForgeFed protocol extension. Gitlab has mentioned they do not give high priority to the issue, but will leave it open for community contribution. At one point implementation-wise things went very fast here, until people involved got other duties.For everyone who'd love to see the fragmented landscape of separate self-hosted code forges become inter-connected and offer similar FOSS project discovery experience as Github: You can help make that a reality.Edit: I should of course also mention Codeberg [4] which runs Forgejo on their servers with some additional facilities for scaling to support their big community. An example where a centralized community hub starts to shape which may one day become a real competitor to Github (where it comes to hosting FOSS repo's).[0] https://forgejo.org[1] https://forgefed.org[2] https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/[3] https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11247[4] https://codeberg.org",
