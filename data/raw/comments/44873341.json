    "textPlain": "I still believe that it'd be easier to add better tooling to the already existing email integration. Nothing is stopping a desktop app to allow users to easily set up git+email and view/comment/apply patches.Activitypub just brings so much complexity. Activitypub works best when you're not using it like a website but rather have a dedicated \"activitypub\" client. Otherwise you'll visit a repo, try to add a pr/issue/etc, it will ask you to sign in to your instance. You'll be redirected, sign in and then see the same repo but on your instance where you can then do the operations. The whole UX is just really confusing.Any new forge that wishes to partake in this social network also has a massive task ahead of it, because creating an activitypub integration is a lot of work. It's not easy. There are also many features like spam filters etc. that are already solved in email that needs to be built as well.Most importantly, people are already signed up to email, so the account signup part is already done too.",

    "textPlain": "It all depends on interest from the developer community. Many devs are rooting for forge federation for years and are waiting for it to happen. Both Forgejo [0] and ForgeFed [1] are fully community-driven free software efforts, and things go as fast as there are people stepping up to do the work.The ActivityPub-related [2] epic at Gitlab [3], which I also linked in another comment, is another example. It is a ramp up to adding support for the ForgeFed protocol extension. Gitlab has mentioned they do not give high priority to the issue, but will leave it open for community contribution. At one point implementation-wise things went very fast here, until people involved got other duties.For everyone who'd love to see the fragmented landscape of separate self-hosted code forges become inter-connected and offer similar FOSS project discovery experience as Github: You can help make that a reality.Edit: I should of course also mention Codeberg [4] which runs Forgejo on their servers with some additional facilities for scaling to support their big community. An example where a centralized community hub starts to shape which may one day become a real competitor to Github (where it comes to hosting FOSS repo's).[0] https://forgejo.org[1] https://forgefed.org[2] https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/[3] https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11247[4] https://codeberg.org",
