Not saying it can be implemented right away, but it should be a policy goal for cities.You have all the right in the world to prefer driving and chilling on your air conditioning and stereo if you can afford it, but it shouldn't be free if you're occupying the lane space 10 people would occupy in a bus, and making the traffic slower for the bus in doing so.",

    "textPlain": "OK, imma just say the quiet part out loud here: There would be less need for daily transportation commutes if companies allowed 100% WFH wehre applicable and the government would force this on companies for the positions that allow remote work. Especially given that Geneva labor market skews heavily towards specialized skilled white collar jobs like diplomats, banking and pharma.But from my job search there and anecdotes from mates and the internet opinions, Swiss companies have a highly mandatory in-office culture, plus the cross-border commuters from neighboring countries who drive in and out every day to benefit both from high Swiss wages and form the cheaper living abroad. Well then no wonder your air quality goes down the shitter.So I doubt that the public transportation not being free is what caused the higher pollution in the first place, since people drive by car not because public transportation costs too much money, but because on their commute route, it saves a lot of time despite the extra cost of car ownership (you can make more money but you can't make more time).To me, it just feels like politicians washing their hands of the elephant in the room: the forced need to commute every day for jobs that don't need it.",
