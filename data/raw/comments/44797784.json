    "textPlain": "Be warned, there are fraudulent sellers on Amazon that sell used drives from this list as new. For example, I ordered two of these drives https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KPL474H. They were both sold as new and arrived in sealed anti-static bags. First one was DOA and the second one's SMART data showed power-on hours of ~3 years!I reported to Amazon and wrote a review but they took my review down for calling it fraud.",

Have you ever tried recording everything your browser views? It'll fill up a terabyte very quickly. Now, what if you want to go back and see something you browsed before? Your browser history is incomplete due to the way HTML5 works. Mobile browsers routinely delete your history. Twitter loves to refresh and make it i possible to find a tweet you've seen, etc. You want to see that page you saw last week talking about gizmo breakthrough X? Good luck, Google is no help.Saving everything automatically that you browse, this is extremely powerful. I feel the outrage against Microsoft recall is largely artificial because of how useful this is for users. They don't want us to have access to powerful desktop tools. This makes synthesizing narratives much more difficult and perfect memory is very bad for this.Don't ask questions, just consume product and then get excited for next product.",
