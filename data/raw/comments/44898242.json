I actually use so many terminal tools that I can't imagine migrating to a bunch of GUI apps. Like gopass for passwords management, git for syncing my notes, nvim for writing etc.With Android 15 you even get a full blown Linux VM running on KVM.I was actually tempted to switch when AAA games like AC got ported to iOS, but then I remembered I love programming more than gaming.",

    "textPlain": "> Offline folders> This is like rsync for your phone. In fact I would not be surprised if this is implemented using rsync. Once you configure an offline folder, it will two-way sync that folder while you use the app. The kicker is: on your phone you can now open that folder in another app (like an editor) and make changes. When you switch back to the shellfish app, the changes are uploaded almost instantly.One can get this killer feature for free with Android and Syncthing.  It’s definitely pretty nice!And of course one can also run Emacs and other free (as in speech or beer) text editors on Android.IIRC there are a couple of ways to get a full Linux command line environment as well.I ended up moving away from it just because ‘typing’ with my thumb is painful.",

So long that the first devices I tried were PDAs with compact-flash micro drives.I actually preferred those devices for development work because the stylus is a much better input device than fat fingers when it comes to precision input. However you then lose the one-handed feature that the author is keen on.These days, MacBook Pros have such long battery lives that I couldn’t imagine wanting to use a phone-form-factor for any serious work. But maybe the new style phones bendable screens that flip open like a book, might tempt me back to using a phone for development work again. Unfortunately such devices are currently Android-only at present.",
