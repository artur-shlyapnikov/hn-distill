Despite its awesome specs, these remain a huge pain in the rear for actual dev work.iPadOS and iPhoneOS will remain useless for actual dev work until they unlock hardware virtualization in Virtualization.framework.Apps on the iPhone and iPad will remain sandboxed, and root isn't possible, so being able to run a VM that _can_ run as root is the next best thing.I believe this framework on mobile uses software emulation, which is horribly slow and guzzles battery.Well, this and third-party browser engine support. Mobile Safari is absolutely horrible. This doesn't become apparent until you're using your iPad full time. Death by a trillion cuts. It also burns battery when you start using it with desktop websites.Until then, the experience is basically you using your iDevice as a dumb terminal (don't mean that as a dig against Termius; great app given its limitations) to some server somewhere where actual work is done. Rendering issues galore if you use vim with color schemes.",

Once you configure an offline folder, it will two-way sync that folder while you use the app. The kicker is: on your phone you can now open that folder in another app (like an editor) and make changes. When you switch back to the shellfish app, the changes are uploaded almost instantly.One can get this killer feature for free with Android and Syncthing.  It’s definitely pretty nice!And of course one can also run Emacs and other free (as in speech or beer) text editors on Android.IIRC there are a couple of ways to get a full Linux command line environment as well.I ended up moving away from it just because ‘typing’ with my thumb is painful.",
