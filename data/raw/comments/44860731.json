    "textPlain": "AI does 0% of my work and we are actively hiring. As someone mentioned on another AI thread, if AI is so good why aren't people just doing 15 PRs a day on open source projects like Node.js, React, Kubernetes, Linux, Ansible, etc?AI is sometimes a productivity booster for a dev, sometimes not. And it's unpredictable when it will and won't be. It's not great at giving you confidence signals when you should be skeptical of its output.In any sufficiently complex software project, as much of the development is about domain knowledge, asking the right questions, balancing resources, guarding against risks, interfacing with a team to scope and vet and iterate on a feature, managing resources, analyzing customer feedback, thinking of new features, improving existing features, etc.When AI is a productivity booster, it's great, but modern software is an evolving, organic product, that requires a team to maintain, expand, improve, etc. As of yet, no AI can take the place of that.",

AI might revolutionize some industry (probably natural-language-adjacent), but not ours.If people can seriously have an AI do 50% of their work, that's usually a confession that they weren't actually doing real work in the first place. Or, at least, they lacked the basic competence with tools that that any university sophomore should have.Sometimes, however, it is instead a confession \"I previously wasn't allowed to copy the preexisting solutions, but thanks to the magic of copyright laundering, now I can!\"",

    "textPlain": "Its a nice productivity and capability boost that feels on the same magnitude as, for example, React. The \"dream\" of it being able to just take tickets and agentically get a PR up for review is possible for ~5% of tickets. That goes up to ~10% if your organization has no standards at all, including even a self-serving standard like \"at least make sure the repository remains useful to future AI usage\".My organization would still hire as many software engineers as we could afford.- Stack Overflow has to be actually dead at this point. There's no reason to go there, or even Google, anymore.- Using it for exploratory high level research and summarization into unfamiliar repos is pretty nice.- Very rarely does AI write code that I feel would last a year without needing to be rewritten. That makes it good for things like knocking out a quick script or updating a button color.- None of them actually follow instructions e.g. in Cursor rules. Its a serious problem. It doesn't matter how many times or where I tell it \"one component per file, one component per file\", all caps, threaten its children, offer it a cookie, it just does whatever it wants.",

We also have Claude in GitHub doing automatic PRs.It’s mostly seen as a force multiplier. Our platform is all Java+Spring so obviously the LLMs are particularly effective because it’s so common. It hasn’t really replaced anyone though, also because it’s Java+Spring so most of our platform is an enormous incomprehensible mess lol",

    "textPlain": "- No major change in hiring due to AI.- A lot of our code base is very specialized and complex, AI still not good enough to replace human judgement/knowledge but can help in various ways.- Not yet clear (to me anyways) how much of a productivity gain we're getting.- We've always had more things we want to do than what we could get done. So if we can get more productivity there's plenty of places to use it. But again, not clear that's actually happening in any major way.I think the jury is still out on this one. Curious what others will say here. My personal opinion is that unless AI gets smart enough to replace more experienced developer completely, and it's far from that, then I'm quite sure there's not going to be less software jobs. If AI gets to a point where it is equal to a good/senior developer we'll have to see. Even then it might be that our jobs will just turn into more managing AI but it's not a zero sum game, we'll do more things. Superintelligence is a different story, i.e. AI that is better than humans in every cognitive aspect.",
