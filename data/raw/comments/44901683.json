    "textPlain": "Very nice! I once had a side project with a built-in PDF viewer. My first version used pdf.js, but when zooming in quickly, it felt sluggish and hard to keep the zoom focus in the right place.So I built my own PDF viewer, this time using pdfium in C++ with Metal for rendering — here’s a quick demo: https://youtu.be/jJMhVn5yzEII implemented a tiling technique to balance memory usage and performance. I didn’t realize pdfium could be so performant in WebAssembly — and honestly, I actually prefer developing UI on the web compared to C++.",
