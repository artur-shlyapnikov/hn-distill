Eventually, she found a way to construct a strange, complicated function out of waves whose frequencies all lay on a curved surface — the type of surface the conjecture required. Usually, when you add these kinds of waves together, they interfere, canceling each other out in some places and reinforcing each other elsewhere.Rather than speaking about her age or the vague notion of talent, I'd be much more interested in why the rest of the academia was unable to replicate her methods in 40 years or so. From her own admission, it was throwing different ideas and approaches until she saw a disprecancy that ultimately disproved the theorem. There should be many people far more experienced who do have the knowledge to do this, but why did they not? This dosen't look like a intuitive jump, seems more like building a test case that fully stressed the theorem.",

It's very sad, but this is reality.So, the problem isn't really that we need to \"invent airplanes\" - we already have them!

That is the level at which \"Exception Handling\" is normally done at a university (above professor, below vice president), and it would normally be the dean of the department that housed the graduate program (some grad programs span multiple departments, which makes it more complicated).Likely, there are also rule systems that would need to be circumvented; for example, while the admissions program for a graduate program would accept the student, the registrar or other entity might then negate that acceptance due to standing policy.  At that point, I wouldn't be surprised if it reached the vice president level of the university (VP of the School that housed the department).Every university handles this slightly differently.  Exceptions can often be made.To qualify you would normally have to do something truly exceptional or show a pattern of continuously excellent (grad student level).
