Gemini Flash is more reasonable[5], but always seems to make the wrong decisions in the end, spinning in circles. OpenAI is better, but still falls short of Claude's performance. Claude also gives back 400's from its API if you CTRL-C in the middle though, so that's annoying.Economics is important. Best bang for the buck seems to be OpenAI ChatGPT 4.1 mini[6]. Does a decent job, doesn't flood my context window with useless tokens like Claude does, API works every time. Gets me out of bad spots.

But I have no idea what the right way to do it is because there are so many paths to choose.Let's see: we have Claude Code vs. Claude the API vs. Claude the website, and they're totally different from each other? One is command line, one integrates into your IDE (which IDE?) and one is just browser based, I guess. Then you have the different pricing plans, Free, Pro, and Max? But then there's also Claude Team and Claude Enterprise? These are monthly plans that only work with Claude the Website, but Claude Code is per-request? Or is it Claude API that's per-request? I have no idea. Then you have the models: Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet, with various version numbers for each?? Then there's Cline and Cursor and GOOD GRIEF!

Really depends on how you use it.(You can do quite a lot in file-at-once mode. E.g.

Often, there's uncertainty and ambiguity that I only understand the correct answer (or rather less bad answer) after I've spent time deep in the code.
