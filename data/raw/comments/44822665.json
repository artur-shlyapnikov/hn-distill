There were earlier railroads, but with dual tracks, stations, signals, tickets, schedules, and reasonably good steam engines, the Liverpool and Manchester worked like a real service. It was profitable. Then lots of others started building and over-building railroads, with varying degrees of success. See Panic of 1847.It was really too early for good railroads. Volume production of steel didn't exist. Early railroads were built with wood and iron, not very well. Around 1880-1900, everything was rebuilt in steel, and got bigger, better, and safer.Consider the early Internet. We had TCP/IP working across the US in the early 1980s, but it wasn't a big deal commercially for another 10-15 years, it wasn't everywhere until the early 2000s, and it wasn't out of bubble mode until 2010 or so.[1] https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intell...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Mania[3] https://youtu.be/pDEnsraYx3k?t=505",

Why not just plot a random sample of firms from both industries?I'd be curious to see the shape of the annualized revenue distribution after a fixed time duration for SaaS and AI firms. Then I could judge whether its fair to filter by the top 100. Maybe AI has a rapid decay rate at low annualized revenue values but a slower decay rate at higher values, when compared to SaaS. Considering that AI has higher marginal costs and thus a larger price of entry, this seems plausible to me. If this is the case, this chart is cherry picking.",
