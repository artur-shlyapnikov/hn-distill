I guess an \"about\" page would be nice to have :) (edit: on panoramax.fr one can read more about it it seems)The content is under a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0.And it is stated that it is compatible with ODbl but the wiki here:https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/ODbL_Compatibilit...says it is not. Likely I'm misunderstanding something.",
