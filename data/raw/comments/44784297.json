    "textPlain": "Ghz speed video processing, even if we only get very basic segmentation or recognition out of it, is probably crazy useful. Need to face recognize every seat at a stadium?Well, if you have enough cameras, 60,000 seats could be scanned 250 thousand times a second. Or if you want to scan a second of video at 60fps, you'd be able to check all of them at a mere 4 thousand times a second.Anyway, good to see interesting raw research. I imagine there are a number of military and security use cases here that could fund something to market (at least a small initial market).",
