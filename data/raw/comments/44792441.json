    "textPlain": "This is super creative. For those who like to reduce their experiences of fun cool stuff, I’ll describe it: Implement a line drawing-on-2D algorithm that maintains geometry on a particular 2d view. Run each of your source images for a Gaussian splat through the line drawing tool. Use those 2d line images to make your splat.Result: a 3d scene that can be posed and shows as a 2d line illustration.I like a lot of things about this, but mostly I like the facility demonstrated here, and the experimentation. So many interesting things to do are in hobbyist reach right now, it’s kind of breathtaking.",
