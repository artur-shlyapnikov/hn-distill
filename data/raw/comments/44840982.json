    "textPlain": "It's got some incredible animation. The story and studio infighting was what hurt the film, but it's still worth a watch if you haven't seen it. It really should have been a better movie. Targeting older audiences was a good idea and fantasy was a big genre. On the animation side The Last Unicorn was a recent success that was also darker fantasy than what disney was offering (fire and ice too, although that didn't get as wide an audience) and in live action Legend released that same year and Willow came after and both attracted a lot of fans. I really wonder what that movie might have been if Disney had been fully committed to the idea.",

I read the first one when I was 12 and I immediately identified with the protagonist.I read the last one last year for the first time aged 40, and like me the character had changed. I doubt I would have understood the message of that last book of the series when I was a kid, a message of the futility of violence and the importance of people.There are so many beautiful things in that book, what touched me most is:\nThe epitaph on the tombstone of their greatest warrior is:\n“Here lies Coll, grower of turnips”, since he himself considered growing things his greatest achievement.",
