    "textPlain": "Nightshades are problematic for stressed and old people because the plants have mild poisons. Old people and addicts tend to not be able to handle the poisons in tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and chilis.But for people that are nightshade-tolerant potatoes are an excellent food crop.IIRC, someone was annoyed that do-gooders wanted to remove potatoes from the food stamp programs, because the potato is actually an almost-complete food. This has morphed into The Potato Diet, which calls for eating potatoes and only potatoes for a short period of time.  From the start of October through November in 2010, \n  Voigt consumed only spuds, a few basic seasonings \n  and small amounts of oil for cooking. His endeavor \n  drew attention from NBC’s Today Show, CBS News, Fox, \n  NPR and the UK’s Daily Telegraph.\n  \n  Voigt documented his journey through a blog \n  ( 20potatoesaday.com ). Tired of potatoes \n  getting a bad rap as being nothing but fattening \n  starch and carbs, he wanted to make a statement \n  that proved potatoes were very nutritious.\n\n- https://spudman.com/article/all-potato-diet-eight-years-late...",

    "textPlain": "I don't think there is any specific feature that makes potatoes unique.Two chromozome copies are typical for animals, but the number of copies in plants varies widely, and and often changes easily, even different variants of the same crop can have different numbers of copies.Underground storage organs are nothing unique, and those of potatoes are not even particularly large. Many places prohibit fig trees for example, because what you see is basically just the tip, and there can be a giant 100m in diameter underground that ruins every underground structure in its path. But it's full of nasty toxic sap, and harvesting it would be a nightmare.It's just the particular combination of fast growth, edibility, and ease of cloning and harvest that makes potatoes unique.",
