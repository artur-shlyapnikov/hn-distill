    "textPlain": "Off-topic but I have to say that potatoes are incredibly easy to grow, and doing so is very worthwhile.I have a small planter on my balcony at the moment which is thriving with leaves, and in a few weeks I'll dig out the harvest to see what I got.   People grow them in very poor soil, and even in literal bags of compost, or buckets.  They're easy-going and almost trouble-free.Growing chillis, tomatoes, or herbs on window-sills is kinda fun and rewarding, but growing a \"proper crop\" feels even more rewarding.  And surprising because you have to wait until you dig things up to see how well you did!",

    "textPlain": "Nightshades are problematic for stressed and old people because the plants have mild poisons. Old people and addicts tend to not be able to handle the poisons in tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and chilis.But for people that are nightshade-tolerant potatoes are an excellent food crop.IIRC, someone was annoyed that do-gooders wanted to remove potatoes from the food stamp programs, because the potato is actually an almost-complete food. This has morphed into The Potato Diet, which calls for eating potatoes and only potatoes for a short period of time.  From the start of October through November in 2010, \n  Voigt consumed only spuds, a few basic seasonings \n  and small amounts of oil for cooking. His endeavor \n  drew attention from NBC’s Today Show, CBS News, Fox, \n  NPR and the UK’s Daily Telegraph.\n  \n  Voigt documented his journey through a blog \n  ( 20potatoesaday.com ). Tired of potatoes \n  getting a bad rap as being nothing but fattening \n  starch and carbs, he wanted to make a statement \n  that proved potatoes were very nutritious.\n\n- https://spudman.com/article/all-potato-diet-eight-years-late...",

Many places prohibit fig trees for example, because what you see is basically just the tip, and there can be a giant 100m in diameter underground that ruins every underground structure in its path. But it's full of nasty toxic sap, and harvesting it would be a nightmare.It's just the particular combination of fast growth, edibility, and ease of cloning and harvest that makes potatoes unique.",
