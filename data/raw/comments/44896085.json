    "textPlain": "When you start at the wrong premise, you typically end up in the wrong place.The premise is that credit cards (visa / Mastercard) is broken. When actually it works really well.For starters it works everywhere. Online. IRL. In my home country, in foreign lands.Secondly it costs the consumer nothing. The cost goes to the merchant. If anything the customer gets rewards.Merchants might pay 3%, (and ultimately yes, that's in the price of goods) but checkout \"just works\". They're in the \"get paid\" business, not the \"teach customer new system\" business. They'll accept new payment options (which the POS) just provides. But they don't drive the market.Fixing Visa doesn't work because the people that matter don't think it's broken.",

    "textPlain": "Super interesting read! I work in payments for context and see tons of different payment methods every day. People tend to find a payment method they like, and really only ever use that one method. It’s very hard to get someone to switch - even if an alternative is better. It’s just so ingrained to swipe that same card, click the same autofill button, etc.Digital wallets did somehow over come this, and those would be a super challenging but potentially valid approach #4. If Zenobia is in Apple Pay, google pay, link, etc it’s natural and easy for customers, saves money for merchants, and disrupts visa/etc without disrupting anything else (ie making people us QR codes).Tough problem. You need a Jony Ive on your team to help solve it.Or do like pix and give everyone $1500, but only if they use Zenobia :)",

    "textPlain": "US consumers are too conservative in the way they expect payments to work—checks are still in circulation and “swipe & sign” has barely been put to rest (has it?). Any system like this would require adoption by a few diverse and large-scale retail institutions to make it worthwhile for consumers to use. Or else it would be a mere alternative to “PayPal me”…",

Merchants have no reason to adopt it if there aren't very many customers that use it, and customers have no reason to adopt it unless there are a lot of merchants, or at least some important frequently used merchants that use it.I think for a new payment system to catch on it needs to either have a significant benefit for both payers and merchants, or be pushed by government policy (for example, require all merchants that meet some criteria to accept the new form of payment).",
