It's sad to see old hardware support getting dropped like that. They are still good machines as servers and desktop terminals.Are there any good Linux distros left with 32-bit x86 support? Do I have to switch to NetBSD?",

By \"derivative distro\" I assume you mean for example Ubuntu, or maybe Linux Mint -- personally my love for Debian is that it's _not_ Ubuntu. There's no \"firefox installed as snap\", it just feels cleaner and snappier while still being very similar to what I'm used to. Debian used to be slightly more difficult to install, but I don't feel that's the case anymore, especially not since they ship non-free firmware on the install media now.",

I remember a time when I was a student where I would change distribution every six months: Fedora, Debian, Archlinux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, etc. but I finally landed on Debian and stayed there as I grew older.In the stable distribution, packages tend to be a little dated obviously, but at least it is _stable_. And you can go with the _testing_ distribution for more up-to-date packages.Also, as a sysadmin, I like having it on my computer to develop and test scripts without having to SSH in a dedicated environment (I still have to eventually but only for the final tests).",

I run Fedora on my desktop/laptop/remote devboxes and use Debian as either a base container image (for Docker/LXC) or as a server (whenever the option is there), and I must say I like Trixie's little CLI quality of life improvements.Not really sure I'd swap Fedora's _really good_ driver support for it, but since I'm running Silverblue and most of my \"civilian\" apps are flatpaks I probably wouldn't notice the difference.",
