Linux devs are now missing kernel regression bugs on 64bit Core 2 Duo hardware because not enough people are using them anymore to catch and report these bugs, and those systems are newer and way more capable for daily driving than 32 bit ones. So then if nobody uses Core 2 Duo machines anymore, how many people do you think are using 32bit Pentium 4/Athlon XP era machines?But let's pretend you're right, and assume there's hoards of Pentium 4 users out there refusing to upgrade for some bizarre reason, and are unhappy they can't run the latest Linux, then using a Pentium 4 with its 80W TDP as a terminal would be an insane waste of energy when that's less capable than some no-name Android table with a 5W ARM SoC which can even play 1080p Youtube while the Pentium 4 cannot even open a modern JS webpage. Even most of the developing world now has more capable mobile devices in their pockets and don't have use for the Pentium 4 machines that have long been landfilled.And legacy industrial systems still running Pentium 4 HW, are just happy to keep running the same Windows XP/Embedded they came from the factory since  those machines are airgapped and don't need to use latest Linux kernel for their purpose.This is literally complaining for the sake of complaining  about problems that almost nobody has since the HW you mention has long been landfilled.>Are there any good Linux distros left with 32-bit x86 support?

They value portability to an extreme, have strong opinions about how linking should be done, separations of concern and what can be considered free software. It's an extremely political distribution with a lot of patching happening to try to shoe horn things into their vision.I personally think it's extremely misguided, breaks a lot of good sotfware, mostly unsafe, a significant drag on the people actually developping what they ship, and basically the embodyment of everything that is wrong with Linux distribution as a concept.
