    "textPlain": "Something I heard recently on some podcast which really resonated was (paraphrasing): \"Inertia is the biggest issue for a startup. The world doesn't like you, doesn't think it needs you... and you've got to invert that. You have to create momentum by scratch and the most important thing a founder does, by an order of magnitude, is invert inertia. Literally, in a physical sense. Like the world stays at rest and you've got to create momentum.\" With that in mind, it makes sense to do things that don't scale... because in the beginning, you're not trying to optimize a machine that's already running. You're trying to get the engine to turn over at all. PG's point is that scalable growth comes later; first, you have to manually crank the thing into motion. You do manual stuff not because it's efficient, but because it's the only way to get traction when no one's looking for you in the first place. And that's how you learn what actually works, how you build momentum one user at a time, and how you prove there's something worth scaling at all.",

    "textPlain": "My theory is that there are three regimes: Not Scaling, Scaling, and Antiscaling.Not Scaling is about crossing and shoring up your moat. Scaling is when your app has enough hype around it that your customers recruit new customers, and all you have to do is add new machines or shard the database or whatever to handle increased demand.Antiscaling is when you turn into the thing that everyone hates about the modern web. Antiscaling is when intelligence agencies want to talk to you about how your chat app is used by terrorists, when cities want to licence access to your ridesharing or takeaway delivery app, when pieces of legislation are passed that are specifically designed to target your company, when you're sufficiently well-known as the founder of an app that people are making memes about you and tracking your personal movements.You don't have to take over the world, you just have to make money. People who try to change the world often change it for the worse; just try to make something useful, and maybe the world will like it.",

    "textPlain": "This is advice that has always sounded good to me on paper but not quite right in practice.Scaffolding is great, until it isn't. It needs to be replaced with something resembling a Real Solution before the Last Responsible Moment comes and goes. But due to Hofstadter's Law as well as Queuing Theory, we can never get the timing right.And so a lot of the devs you encounter who fight this have found themselves spending a lot of time throwing good money after bad, keeping a broken system working just enough that the customers don't defect, while trying to also find the time to replace the broken system, which is also always being made more difficult by the changes being made to keep the busted shit kinda working.And so at some point they just say Enough. I'm not going to lie to myself and my coworkers by saying \"We'll fix that later\" because \"later\" never comes, only \"too late\" comes.There are ways to spin this however. If the customer trusts that you know what you're doing and that you will eventually get to all of their problems, they'll stay put while you work on them. But you have to telegraph competence and then deliver on it. There's a needle you can thread there where you use not shipping systems that Don't Scale... ridiculously badly, you can tell the users to expect quality.I will say this, as a compromise: It is almost always better to ship systems that scale too expensively than ones that don't scale at all - as long as that scaling leads directly to revenue. You're only shortening your runway by decreasing margins or taking them narrow. But if your customer base plateaus because you just can't onboard them anymore, what investor is going to float you more money to extend that runway?I have always found it easier to negotiate priority on feature and story work that's attached to a new revenue stream (eg, new account) than ones that only reduce our OPEX.

And the ability to project confidence about what is otherwise an absolute fantasy that doesn't yet exist. Which is what many startups are until they get their house in order (with VC funding). Sometimes VCs get it right and they'll bore you endlessly about their successes. But the 95% that fail that they also invested in and probably shouldn't have is what they generally don't talk about a lot other than in terms of vague hints about acquihires, mergers, and other tried and proven strategies to make a bad investment look like a good one. The unremarkable airbnb clone, the tinder for X, Y, and Z that never panned out. The too good to be true yet-another market place that amounted to little. All of those.If you are bootstrapping with revenue instead of money, customers won't be lining up for a product that won't work. They won't be interested in your self serving story about how you built the thing with duct-tape and mud while surviving on ramen noodles without sleeping for five months. That would scare them away probably. You actually need to build something that they would 1) buy and then 2) be happy about buying. And you won't have any VC donated cash to wow/lure/distract them with marketing either. You actually need to sell on product merit rather than founder reputation instead of using your reputation to separate VCs from their cash just so you can get the resources you need to not fake the product. Once the product has proven itself, the VC is redundant.It's a very different game. Most of the things that work with VCs won't work with customers. And vice versa (you are going to slow, you should be focusing on X instead of Y, and all the other nonsense).But the good news is, you won't need to scale for a while because bootstrapping isn't a fast process. The bad news is that you might not have a lot of time to fix your scaling issues when you do encounter them and they can and wi",

So they build highly scalable things before the slightest need for horizontal scaling even arises.I think that vertical scaling is underappreciated. Just throwing more resources at your monolithic backend can buy you quite enough time to understand how to best scale your product. More importantly, it may give you the time to reconsider what are the key strengths of your product that the users are for, and thus to understand what needs scaling.Also, when users really love your product, they will excuse you for its spotty performance. Early Twitter was built on a hugely inadequate architecture (a Rails app), and kept melting and crashing; remember the \"fail whale\"? Despite that, users were coming to it in droves, because it did the key things right.To my mind, the early stage is all about easy iteration and finding out what makes users happy and enthusiastic. Ignore scaling; experiment, listen to the users, talk to the users. When it clicks, you can consider scaling. It may happen at a point you did not anticipate, and could not optimize for.Technology is a tool, an instrument. It's great to have a Stradivarius, but you need some good music first.",

Yet I had someone on my team who was obsessed with optimizing everything, to the point of changing his entire code base to a new language that only he knew, so he could save a few milliseconds on paper. Aside from him, no one noticed, no one cared. His optimizations just introduced risk, as he was the only one who could support what he built.

It might not be worth the resource cost to achieve it, but disregarding that, its the best.Whereas \"Do things that Dont Scale\" is suggesting the non-scaled process may be the optimal one. For example (and this sort of thing is in the article IIRC), giving direct contact details to the CEO instead of a generic form that get's sent to some shared customer service/sales inbox. Way better process for selling your product. The inquiry form scales but its in no way a premature \"optimization.\"Another way of putting it is that SCALING IS BAD. Or to be a bit more nuanced, it's a necessary evil. It's complex. It's resource intensive. It creates distance between you and your customer. Of course business goals and environment may dictate it, but that doesn't mean none of the processes are degrading in quality.

If they put in the effort to figure this out what they tend to find is that they are hemorrhaging money to third parties.I know plenty of CTO's, vp's and Team leads and SR engineers who dont know what the rent vs buy calculation is, never mind how to do it.

    "textPlain": "I think there's nuance missing from his take that people gloss over.To me it's more like \"don't over-invest on the early thing you're going to throw away\". That implies that:- You're making a thing, and making it quickly - optimizing for rapid market/customer feedback- You're making it in such a way that you can replace it- You have real plans and a sincere intention to actually replace it if you start to scaleI have no problem with those, but what I see at a bunch of startups is:- Make a thing, don't worry about paining yourself into a corner because \"we're moving fast\"- The thing hobbles along, the product gets some interest- It's incredibly hard to maintain, replace or otherwise improve- Original authors leave to other pastures because this isn't fun any more- Other folks come along and have to work miracles to try to undo the gordian knots that were madeIn other words: I like the idea of moving fast early on. Duct tape programming, love it. We also have to pay attention to the long term impacts of the decisions we're making. Some things are easy to fix/replace/undo, others are brutally hard.Say you write a prototype in {Ruby/Python/Perl/??}, now you have mass adoption and you rewrite a slow part of it in {sexy_modern_language}. That's great.Say instead that you decided to store all of your data in some bizarre format, hosted on IPFS, accessed via bittorrent, through an onion network, via ZModem, with CORBA - and you bake this in to such a degree that it's intermingled everywhere. Now you have a dilema:- you have a business, making money- you have increasing interest- you have a system that's effectively impossible to change or reason about- you can't really improve things to match the customer interest- you're wedded to the design because things are so interwoven- your only option is essentially a ground-up redesign and rewriteNow - if the product is simple enough, rewrite away! (think early Twitter), but if it's not? Good luck to you.I've seen this pattern more",

    "textPlain": "> - Interview failed founders, not successful ones: They'll tell you why things actually break (co-founder fights, cash flow, timing) instead of survivorship bias fairy tales.I like this idea a lot, if it can be done well.Is there already trove of failed tech startup stories that are genuine, and maybe analyzed like business case studies?  Is it publicly-accessible, or could it be?I think the biggest challenge is getting truthful and complete information.  (People will have made embarrassing mistakes, no matter how much brilliant heroism the team also pulled off.  There will be things the failed founders don't want past customers/partners/investors to know.  There will be things investors don't want known about their own behavior.  For growth startups, there may be investment fraud at some level, for example.  Or backstabbing.  There will be differences of perspective on what really happened.  There may be personality disorders.  Etc.)A lot of people will tolerate a disposable \"incredible journey\" post to put a less-negative spin on failure, but AFAICT usually no one involved really wants all the truth to get out.Also, if you do it, ideally it would be for all startups.  If you only do it for some, without all being humbled simultaneously, then current convention is to look down upon those with the transparency, while pretending the non-transparent ones are better.  It's a pretty dim-witted and petty culture, and we have to structure with that in mind.",
