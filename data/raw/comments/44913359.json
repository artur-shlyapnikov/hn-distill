You'll get first hand experience and feedback.\n 2/Avoid the upfront cost of \"something that scales\", and thus get quicker feedback.\n 3/Makes you different, very important in the beginning.\"Do things that don't scale\" is a way to drive the point home and must not be taken literally...",

    "textPlain": "This is a great article! My cofounders and I read it when we were first starting our business, and it significantly impacted the decisions we make, usually for the better. But don’t forget to scale at some point!! For example, we’re still doing our own bookkeeping and tax filing. When we started it was simple and it was a “thing that doesn’t scale” which we could still do. But at this point it’s a waste of time. We’re finally outsourcing it, probably a year later than we should have. I think we overindexed on Paul’s advice a bit. Which, to be clear, is still really really good advice, just don’t take it too far.Edit: business is mydragonskin.com",
