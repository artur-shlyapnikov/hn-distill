You'll get first hand experience and feedback.\n 2/Avoid the upfront cost of \"something that scales\", and thus get quicker feedback.\n 3/Makes you different, very important in the beginning.\"Do things that don't scale\" is a way to drive the point home and must not be taken literally...",

    "textPlain": "My theory is that there are three regimes: Not Scaling, Scaling, and Antiscaling.Not Scaling is about crossing and shoring up your moat. Scaling is when your app has enough hype around it that your customers recruit new customers, and all you have to do is add new machines or shard the database or whatever to handle increased demand.Antiscaling is when you turn into the thing that everyone hates about the modern web. Antiscaling is when intelligence agencies want to talk to you about how your chat app is used by terrorists, when cities want to licence access to your ridesharing or takeaway delivery app, when pieces of legislation are passed that are specifically designed, when you're sufficiently well-known as the founder of an app that people are making memes about you and tracking your personal movements.You don't have to take over the world, you just have to make money. People who try to change the world often change it for the worse; just try to make something useful, and maybe the world will like it.",

But don’t forget to scale at some point!! For example, we’re still doing our own bookkeeping and tax filing. When we started it was simple and it was a “thing that doesn’t scale” which we could still do. But at this point it’s a waste of time. We’re finally outsourcing it, probably a year later than we should have. I think we overindexed on Paul’s advice a bit. Which, to be clear, is still really really good advice, just don’t take it too far.Edit: business is mydragonskin.com",

    "textPlain": "If you are going to be VC funded. Yes, absolutely. All you need is smoke and mirrors. And the ability to project confidence about what is otherwise an absolute fantasy that doesn't yet exist. Which is what many startups are until they get their house in order (with VC funding). Sometimes VCs get it right and they'll bore you endlessly about their successes. But the 95% that fail that they also invested in and probably shouldn't have is what they generally don't talk about a lot other than in terms of vague hints about acquihires, mergers, and other tried and proven strategies to make a bad investment look like a good one. The unremarkable airbnb clone, the tinder for X, Y, and Z that never panned out. The too good to be true yet-another market place that amounted to little. All of those.If you are bootstrapping with revenue instead of money, customers won't be lining up for a product that won't work. They won't be interested in your self serving story about how you built the thing with duct-tape and mud while surviving on ramen noodles without sleeping for five months. That would scare them away probably. You actually need to build something that they would 1) buy and then 2) be happy about buying. And you won't have any VC donated cash to wow/lure/distract them with marketing either. You actually need to sell on product merit rather than founder reputation instead of using your reputation to separate VCs from their cash just so you can get the resources you need to not fake the product. Once the product has proven itself, the VC is redundant.It's a very different game. Most of the things that work with VCs won't work with customers. And vice versa (you are going to slow, you should be focusing on X instead of Y, and all the other nonsense).But the good news is, you won't need to scale for a while because bootstrapping isn't a fast process. The bad news is that you might not have a lot of time to fix your scaling issues when you do encounter them and they can and wi",

We know how big our environment is, there isn’t much sensitivity to performance, and we don’t see random spikes that we don’t cause ourselves. Yet I had someone on my team who was obsessed with optimizing everything, to the point of changing his entire code base to a new language that only he knew, so he could save a few milliseconds on paper. Aside from him, no one noticed, no one cared. His optimizations just introduced risk, as he was the only one who could support what he built. When he left, we threw the whole thing away at management’s demand. Had it been a little more simple and slow, someone else probably could have taken it over without as much effort.",
