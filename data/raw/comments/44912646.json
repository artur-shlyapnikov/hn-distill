So they will never replicate the human mind; they can just mimic it.I heard from Miguel Nicolelis that language is a filter for the human mind, so you can never build a mind from language.

    "textPlain": "> LLMs mimic intelligence, but they aren’t intelligent.I see statements like this a lot, and I find them unpersuasive because any meaningful definition of \"intelligence\" is not offered. What, exactly, is the property that humans (allegedly) have and LLMs (allegedly) lack, that allows one to be deemed \"intelligent\" and the other not?I see two possibilities:1. We define \"intelligence\" as definitionally unique to humans. For example, maybe intelligence depends on the existence of a human soul, or specific to the physical structure of the human brain. In this case, a machine (perhaps an LLM) could achieve \"quacks like a duck\" behavioral equality to a human mind, and yet would still be excluded from the definition of \"intelligent.\" This definition is therefore not useful if we're interested in the ability of the machine, which it seems to me we are. LLMs are often dismissed as not \"intelligent\" because they work by inferring output based on learned input, but that alone cannot be a distinguishing characteristic, because that's how humans work as well.2. We define \"intelligence\" in a results-oriented way. This means there must be some specific test or behavioral standard that a machine must meet in order to become intelligent. This has been the default definition for a long time, but the goal posts have shifted. Nevertheless, if you're going to disparage LLMs by calling them unintelligent, you should be able to cite a specific results-oriented failure that distinguishes them from \"intelligent\" humans. Note that this argument cannot refer to the LLMs' implementation or learning model.",

The machine approach was very brute force, and there was a lot of work done to improve the sheer amount of look ahead that was required to complete at the grandmaster level.As opposed to what grandmasters actually did, which was less look ahead and more pattern matching to strengthen the position.Now LLMs successfully leverage pattern matching, but interestingly it is still a kind of brute force pattern matching, requiring the statistical absorption of all available texts, far more than a human absorbs in a lifetime.This enables the LLM to interpolate an answer from the structure of the absorbed texts with reasonable statistical relevance. This is still not quite “what humans do” as it still requires brute force statistical analysis of vast amounts of text to achieve pretty good results. For example training on all available Python sources in github and elsewhere (curated to avoid bad examples) yields pretty good results, not how a human would do it, but statistically likely to be pertinent and correct.",

    "textPlain": "I've mentioned this to colleagues at work before.LLMs give a very strong appearance of intelligence, because humans are super receptive to information provided via our native language.  We often have to deal with imperfect speakers and writers, and we must infer context and missing information on our own.  We do this so well that we don't know we're doing it.  LLMs have perfect grammar and we subtly feel that they are extremely smart because subconsciously we recognize that we don't have to think about anything that's said, it is all syntactically perfect.So, LLMs sort of trick us into masking their true limitations and believing that they are truly thinking; there are even models that call themselves thinking models, but they don't think, they just predict what the user is going to complain about and say that to themselves as an additional, dynamic prompt on top of the one you actually enter.LLMs are very good at fooling us into the idea that they know anything at all; they don't.  And humans are very bad at being discriminate about the source of the information presented to them if it is presented in a friendly way.  The combination of those things is what has resulted in the insanely huge AI hype cycle that we are currently living in the middle of.  Nearly everyone is overreacting to what LLMs actually are, and the few of us that believe that we sort of see what's actually happening are ignored for being naysayers, buzz-kills, and luddites.

If it could, then we could genuinely describe its output as \"context,\" and phrase our problem as \"there is still a gap in needed context, despite how much context there already is.\"And an LLM that simply \"shortens\" that context could reach a level of AGI, because the context preparation is doing the heavy lifting.The point I think the article is trying to make is that LLMs cannot add any information beyond the context they are given - they can only \"shorten\" that context.If the lived experience necessary for human-level judgment could be encoded into that context, though... that would be an entirely different ball game.",
