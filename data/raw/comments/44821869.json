    "textPlain": "> It handles complex coding tasks with minimal prompting...I find it interesting how marketers are trying to make minimal prompting a good thing, a direction to optimize. Even if i talk to a senior engineer, i'm trying to be specific as possible to avoid ambiguities etc. Pushing the models to just do what they think its best is a weird direction. There are so many subtle things/understandings of the architecture that are just in my head or a colleagues head.  Meanwhile, i found that a very good workflow is asking claude code to come back with clarifying questions and then a plan, before just starting to execute.",

    "textPlain": "> GPT-5 will have \"enhanced agentic capabilities” and can handle “complex coding tasks with minimal prompting.”this seems to be directly targeted at anthropic/claude, wonder if it leads anywhere or if claude keeps it's mystical advantage (especially with new claude models coming out this week as well).> GPT-5 will have four model variants, according to GitHub...i also find it interesting that the primary model is the logic-focused one (likely very long and deep reasoning), whereas the conversational mainstream model is now a variant. seems like a fundamental shift in how they want these tools to be used, as opposed to today's primary 4o and the more logical GPT-4.1, o4-mini, and o3.",
