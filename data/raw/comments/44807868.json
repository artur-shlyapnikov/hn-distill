In one stroke it turns voice everywhere from a hardware/licensing problem into a packaging problem. Quality tweaks can come later; unlocking that deployment tier is the real game-changer.",

I tested F5-TTS with an old NVidia 1660 (6GB VRAM) and it worked ok-ish, so running it on a little more modern hardware will not cost you a fortune and produce MUCH higher quality with multi-language and zero-shot support.For Android there is SherpaTTS[3], which plays pretty well with most TTS Applications.1: https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech2: https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS3: https://github.com/woheller69/ttsengine",

Frankly as long as a voice is clear and you listen to it for a while, the brain filters out most quirks you would perceive on the first pass. Hence why many blind folks still are perfectly fine using espeak-ng. The other properties like speed of generation and size make it worth it.I've been using a custom AI audiobook generation program [0] with piper for quite a while now and am very excited to look at integrating kitten. Historically piper has been the only good option for a free CPU-only local model so I am super happy to see more competition in the space. Easy installation is a big deal, since piper historically has had issues with that. (Hence why I had to add auto installation support in [0])[0] https://github.com/C-Loftus/QuickPiperAudiobook",
