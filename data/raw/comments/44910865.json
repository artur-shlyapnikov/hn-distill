You are a hacker at heart.When I went to the US for 3 months I joined PureGym and they gave me a PIN number. I cancelled my membership after that, and one day Chrome told me my PureGym PIN had been compromised. 2 years later, I went to the US again, rejoined, and received the same PIN. Massive red flag.I was also intrigued by the app, the token and PIN, and remember finding a security flaw in the system that activates the hydro massage chairs. It accepts your PIN or any PIN, with no security at all.",
