All western labs hide their best results, or at most release summaries that are about as meaningful as the answers Cleo used to give on stack exchange: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/562694/integral-int...I have a suspicion with how quiet all the major players got after the two weeks after deepseek R1 was released that they were reading and implementing everything in the papers that came with it as fast as humanly possible.",

I'm not super familiar with all the technical aspects, but that seems like it should be one of the main focuses of the paper.",

    "textPlain": "I am always skeptical of RNN approaches but this paper is just sparsifying the input, it is not compressing any size input to a fixed memory. I am hopeful maybe this is a big break. 11x inference speedup with no degradation from an algorithmic improvement. Is it really that good? almost too good to be true. Adoption in the next 6 months will tell us the truth.",
