Even conservatively assuming I had 1 billion crawled pages, each with 1K tokens (abnormally long), it would only cost $100 to generate embeddings for all of them. By comparison, running my own inference, even with cheap Runpod spot GPUs, would cost on the order of 100× more expensive, to say nothing of other APIs.\"I wonder if OpenAI uses this as a honeypot to get domain-specific source data into its training corpus that it might otherwise not have access to.",

I'm not sure how LLM is being used in this regard in here.One effective old technique for ranking is to capture the search-to-click relationship by real users. It's basically the training data by human mapping the search terms they entered to the links they clicked. With just a few of clicks, the ranking relevance goes way up.May be feeding the data into a neural net would help ranking. It becomes a classification problem - given these terms, which links have higher probabilities being clicked. More people clicking on a link for a term would strengthening the weights.",

Meta-pages \"specialising\" in broad rankings are preferred above specialist data about the specific sought-after item. It seems that the desire for a ranking weighs the most.If I were to manually try to answer this query, I would start by looking at hardware forums and geeky blogs, pick N candidates, then try to find the specifications and quirks for all products.Of course, it is difficult to generically answer if a given website has performed this analysis. It can be favourable to rank sites citing specific data higher in these circumstances.As a user, I would prefer to be presented with the initial sources used for assembling this analysis. Of course, this doesn't happen because engines don't perform this kind of bottom-to-top evaluation.",
