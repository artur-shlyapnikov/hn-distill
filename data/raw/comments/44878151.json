    "textPlain": "This then begs the question for me, without an LLM what is the approach to build a search engine? Google search used to be razor sharp, then it degraded in the late 2000s and early 2010s and now its meh. They filter out so much content for a billion different reasons and the results are just not what they used to be. I've found better results from some LLMs like Grok (surprisingly) but I can't seem to understand why what was once a razor exact search engine like Google, it cannot find verbatim or near verbatim quotes of content I remember seeing on the internet.",

    "textPlain": "My understanding was that every few months Google was forced to adjust their algorithms because the search results would get flooded by people using black hat SEO techniques. At least that's the excuse I heard for why it got so much worse over time.Not sure if that's related to it ignoring quotes and operators though. I'd imagine that to be a cost saving measure (and very rarely used, considering it keeps accusing me of being a robot when I do...)From what I understand, that good old Google from the 2000s was built entirely without any kind of machine learning. Just a keyword index and PageRank. Everything they added since then seems to have made it worse (though it did also degrade \"organically\" from the SEO spam).",
