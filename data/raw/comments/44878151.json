    "textPlain": "Just wow. My greatest respect! Also an incredible write up. I like the take-away that an essential ingredient to a search engine is curated and well filtered data (garbage in garbage out) I feel like this has been a big learning of the LLM training too, rather work with less much higher quality data. I'm curious how a search engine would perform where all content has been judged by an LLM.",

    "textPlain": "This is really really cool. I had earlier wanted to entirely run my searches on it and though that seems possible, I feel like it would be sadly a little bit more waste of time in terms of searches but still I'll maybe try to run some of my searches against this too and give me thoughts on this after doing something like this if I could, like, it is a big hit or miss but it will almost land you to the right spot, like not exactly.For example, I searched lemmy hoping to find the fediverse and it gave me their liberapay page though.Please, actually follow up on that common crawl promise and maybe even archive.org or other websites too and I hope that people are spending billions in this AI industry, I just hope that you can whether even through funding or just community crowdwork, actually succeed in creating such an alternative. People are honestly fed up with the current search engine almost monopoly.Wasn't Ecosia trying to roll out their own search engine, They should definitely take your help or have you in their team..I just want a decentralized search engine man, I understand that you want to make it sustaianable and that's why you haven't open sourced but please, there is honestly so much money going into potholes doing nothing but make our society worse and this project almost works good enough and has insane potential...Please open source it and lets hope that the community tries to figure out a way around some ways of monetization/crowd funding to actually make it sustainableBut still, I haven't read the blog post in its entirety since I was so excited that I just started using the search engine.., But I feel like the article feels super indepth and that this idea can definitely help others to create their own proof of concepts or actually create some open source search engine that's decent once and for all.Not going to lie, But this feels like a little magic and I am all for it. I have never been this excited the more I think about it of such projects in ac",

Google search used to be razor sharp, then it degraded in the late 2000s and early 2010s and now its meh. They filter out so much content for a billion different reasons and the results are just not what they used to be. I've found better results from some LLMs like Grok (surprisingly) but I can't seem to understand why what was once a razor exact search engine like Google, it cannot find verbatim or near verbatim quotes of content I remember seeing on the internet.",

At least that's the excuse I heard for why it got so much worse over time.Not sure if that's related to it ignoring quotes and operators though. I'd imagine that to be a cost saving measure (and very rarely used, considering it keeps accusing me of being a robot when I do...)From what I understand, that good old Google from the 2000s was built entirely without any kind of machine learning. Just a keyword index and PageRank. Everything they added since then seems to have made it worse (though it did also degrade \"organically\" from the SEO spam).",
