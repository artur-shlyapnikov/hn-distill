    "textPlain": "That's absolutely hilarious and seems to have several contradictions.Firstly, when you access the website you see \"European Search Perspective\" which sounds official and as a government organisation, but actually it's not, just a joint venture of Ecosia and Qwant.European Search Perspective states \"This index will be an alternative results provider for a diverse set of small search engines, startups and the European Data / AI industry.\", but what about EU data?\nQwant sometimes uses Bing[1]. Ecosia sometimes uses Google or Bing[2]. This can be contrasted with Staan.ai, which claims it \"Uses our own proprietary index...not a proxy of Google\".Ok, at least it could give freedom as it's an index. But what a pity again! \"Uses our own PrOpRiEtArY index, we do everything from crawling, indexing, ranking (not a proxy of Google) and serving so that you have the best experience possible.\"[3]AI? What about Ecosia's AI? \"To use the AI Chat, you need to agree to Ecosia’s terms of service and privacy policy. Query requests are shared with external chat providers such as OpenAI and chat history is stored in your browser’s local storage. Never share personal data in the chat.\"[4]\"sovereign, privacy-first search infrastructure for Europe\"[5]. But what about[2]? \"we automatically collect data required by search partners ... - which includes your IP address and search terms.\"To me this looks like an aggressive attempt to capture the European market and has nothing to do with privacy and European values, of course it's only my opinion and I hope privacy and confidentiality will only grow in EU.Still SearXNG sounds like the best free alternative to Google and other giants.[1] \"In reality, Qwant uses Bing to supplement search results on which we do not have sufficient relevance, and on images where storage capacities are very important.\"\nhttps://betterweb.qwant.com/en/2023/09/18/web-indexing-where...[2] We are gradually rolling out our new unique search offer.
