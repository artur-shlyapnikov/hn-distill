This is my baseline, it was generated with their v4 model and so far it has remained my favorite AI generated song. I regularly listen to this one track and it brings me joy. There's many places where I think it could be drastically improved, but none of the competitors have managed to surpass it nor have they provided tools to improve upon it. The pronunciation is a bit bad sometimes and it fails to hold notes as long as I wish, but overall it has gotten the closest to my vision.Eleven Music's version of Mandate of Heaven [1]. They don't allow free accounts to export or share the full song so you can only try a small fragment. It has much crisper instruments and vocals, but it has terrible pacing issues and pronunciation. The track is 4 minutes long, but the singer is just rushing through the track at wildly unexpected speeds. I cannot even play the song after it finished generating, so I haven't even been able to listen to the whole thing, it just gets stuck when I press play. Maybe some kind of release-day bug. The only tool that Eleven Music gives you for refining and modifying sections is \"Edit Style\", which feels pretty limiting. But I can't even try it because the track won't play.Producer.ai's version of Mandate of Heaven [2][3]. This one has slightly worse instruments than Eleven Music, but the vocals are a bit better than Suno v4. It also has severe timing issues. I tried asking it to generate the track without a vibe reference [2] and also with a vibe reference [3]. Both versions have terrible pacing issues; somehow the one with the vibe reference is particularly egregious, like it's trying to follow the input vibe but getting confused.It feels like AI song generation is just in a really awkward place, where you don't get enough customization capabilities to really refine tracks into the perfect direction that you're imagining.
