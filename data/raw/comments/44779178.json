    "textPlain": "I’m not sure this title is completely correct“The researchers identified the type of water loss on land, and for the first time, found that 68% came from groundwater alone — contributing more to sea level rise than glaciers and ice caps on land.”They are saying the leading loss of water loss is from ground water. The largest contributor to sea level rise I would guess is still thermosteric sea level rise due to the ocean becoming warmer and less denseSee ipcc https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9/9.6.1 Global and Regional Sea Level Change in the Instrumental EraIn particular, Cross-Chapter 9.1, Figure 1 | Global Energy Inventory and Sea Level Budget.
