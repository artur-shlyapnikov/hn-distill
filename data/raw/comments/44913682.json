Let it nuke your containers and your volumes because why the fuck not (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5632). Let the vibecoders put out thousands of lines of shit code for their stealth B2B startup that's basically a wrapper around OpenAI and MySQL (5.7, because ChatGPT read online that MERN is a super popular stack but relational databases are gooder), then laugh at them when it inevitably gets \"hacked\" (the user/pw combo was admin/admin and PHPMyAdmin was open to the internet). Burn through thousands of CPU hours generating dogshit code, organising \"agents\" that cost you 15 cents to do a curl https://github.com/api/what-did-i-break-in/cba3df677. Have Gemini record all your meetings, then don't read the notes it made, and make another meeting with 5 different people the next week.It will reveal a bunch of things: which companies are ran by incompetent leaders, which ones are running on incompetent engineers, which ones keep existing because some dumbass VC wants to throw money in the money burning pit.Stand back, have a laugh.
