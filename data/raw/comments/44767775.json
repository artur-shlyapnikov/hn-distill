    "textPlain": "Fun demo but the model that's used seems to be pretty stupid:> What's the best way to get to space?>> Unfortunately, it's not currently possible for humans to travel to space in the same way that astronauts do. While there have been several manned missions to space, such as those to the International Space Station, the technology and resources required to make interstellar travel feasible are still in the early stages of development.>> Currently, the fastest spacecraft is the Apollo missions, which took around 77 hours to reach the Moon. From there, they traveled to other planets, but the distances between them are so great that even at high speeds, it would take many years to reach them.>> As for traveling to space itself, there are no commercial or private companies that offer space travel services, and the cost of such a journey is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars per person.>> However, there are some concepts and technologies being explored that might one day make space travel more accessible and affordable. For example, private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are working on developing reusable rockets that could potentially take people to space more quickly and reliably.>> But for now, let's just say that space travel is still in the future, and we'll have to wait a bit longer for humans to venture into the cosmos!",

It's currently the Gemini Nano model on Chrome, and they are testing a version of the Gemma 3n model in beta channels. Edge uses phi-4-mini.More information is available here: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/prompt-api",
