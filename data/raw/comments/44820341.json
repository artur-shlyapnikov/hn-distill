    "textPlain": "These two crates follow different philosophies. file-type is great for lightweight, static detection. In contrast, `magical_rs` is designed to be a framework — it lets you define custom rules, layer logic via DSLs, and even embed custom function pointers for advanced matching.\nSo if your use-case involves complex formats, edge-case detection, or internal tooling where you need full control — magical_rs gives you the power without forcing you to fork the crate.",
