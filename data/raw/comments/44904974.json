Was really cool to get to play with Cerberus for the first time as well.I'm really interested in learning more about how devs integrate MCP security into their routine code evals.I think there's a big opportunity as a space to get tools like this into CI/CD pipelines and workflows.Happy to answer any questions and happy to hear any feedback!Thanks for checking it out :)",

    "textPlain": "this is super interesting! MCP is really exciting in terms of what it can unlock for agent use cases, but still the wild west in terms of security. I was on a panel discussion yesterday where this topic came up, basically how do you trust the use of AI tools when so much is still unknown. I think the the idea of using something open source and tool agnostic is appealing, the landscape is evolving so fast that horizontal solutions like this feel valuable. Although I wish clients, anthropic, cursor, etc would build more protections in too so that we didn't have to spend so much time thinking about this. but they've barely implemented remote mcp support so I think we have a ways to go.",

    "textPlain": "This is definitely valuable. I started paying attention to MCP security vulnerabilities largely because of Defcon. I believe that they largely focused on Agentic Security as a theme this time around.It's a bit mind blowing how we've simply accepted non-technical people within orgs in particular executing code to \"automate their tasks\" without the same level of rigor that normal code reviews go through. Definitely think that this is a cultural issue that we must fix.And these MCP vulnerabilities in particular seem much scarier because almost all MCP tools require an insane amount of permissions.",

    "textPlain": "I'm going to pick a fight on this one; I think you know I'm a fan, so take this in the spirit I intend†.My contention is that \"lethal trifecta\" is the AI equivalent of self-XSS. It's not apparent yet, because all this stuff is just months old, but a year from now we'll be floored by the fact that people just aimed Cursor or Claude Code at a prod database.To my lights, the core security issue with tool/function calling in agents isn't MCP; it's context hygiene. Because people aren't writing their own agents, they're convinced that the single-visible-context-window idiom of tools like Cursor are just how these systems work. But a context is just a list of strings. You can have as any of them in an agent as you want.Once you've got untrusted data hitting one context window, and sensitive tool calls isolated in another context window, the problem of securing the system isn't much different than it is with a traditional web application; some deterministic code that a human reviewed and pentested mediates between those contexts, transforming untrusted inputs into trustable commands for the sensitive context.That's not a trivial task, but it's the same task as we do now when, for instance, we need to generate a PDF invoice in an invoicing application. Pentesters find vulnerabilities in those apps! But it's not a news story when it happens, so much.† More a note for other people who might thing I'm being irritable. :)",
