    "textPlain": "this is super interesting! MCP is really exciting in terms of what it can unlock for agent use cases, but still the wild west in terms of security. I was on a panel discussion yesterday where this topic came up, basically how do you trust the use of AI tools when so much is still unknown. I think the the idea of using something open source and tool agnostic is appealing, the landscape is evolving so fast that horizontal solutions like this feel valuable. Although I wish clients, anthropic, cursor, etc would build more protections in too so that we didn't have to spend so much time thinking about this. but they've barely implemented remote mcp support so I think we have a ways to go.",

Was really cool to get to play with Cerberus for the first time as well.I'm really interested in learning more about how devs integrate MCP security into their routine code evals.I think there's a big opportunity as a space to get tools like this into CI/CD pipelines and workflows.Happy to answer any questions and happy to hear any feedback!Thanks for checking it out :)",

    "textPlain": "This is definitely valuable. I started paying attention to MCP security vulnerabilities largely because of Defcon. I believe that they largely focused on Agentic Security as a theme this time around.It's a bit mind blowing how we've simply accepted non-technical people within orgs in particular executing code to \"automate their tasks\" without the same level of rigor that normal code reviews go through. Definitely think that this is a cultural issue that we must fix.And these MCP vulnerabilities in particular seem much scarier because almost all MCP tools require an insane amount of permissions.",

Yeah we have thought about this being part of dev workflow via Github Actions and locally for the dev environment too. Love to hear what you are building!",

    "textPlain": "I know right? I mean the timing is great. I love MCP but cant stand how unsafe it is. I think there are greatness ahead if we are able to fix this security issue. This was made around the idea to be as seamless as possible, as we built a dashboard, drop in a GH project MCP server link, and have a local DB to show what you ran. We have more great things ahead. But give it a try and let us know what you think!",
