True, you want cattle, but being able to include some bare metal instance with amazing CPUs and memory would be great, and I do just that. My clusters include both cloud and bare metal instances. In the past I had used Hetzner virtual switch to create a shared L2 network between cloud and bare metal nodes. Now I just use tailscale.But the TF and other tools are using the API to add and kill nodes, if you could pass a class of nodes to those tools that they know can't create but are able to wipe and rebuild, this would be ideal.",
