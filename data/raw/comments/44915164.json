We deploy clients onto their bare metal line-up which we find to be pretty rock solid. The worst that typically happens is the scheduled restart of an upstream router, which we mitigate via multi-AZ deployments.That being said, there is a base cluster size under which a custom bare-metal deployment isn't really viable in terms of economics/effort. So I'll definitely keep an eye on this.",

It's a slog to get it all working, but for our use case, having a dedicated 10G LAN between nodes (and a bare metal Cassandra cluster in the same rack) makes a big difference in performance.Also, from a cost perspective. We run AX41-NVMe dedicated servers that cost us about EUR 64 per server with a 10G LAN, all in the same rack. Getting the same horsepower using Cloud instances I guess would be a CCX43, which costs almost double.",
