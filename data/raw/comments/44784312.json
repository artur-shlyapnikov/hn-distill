Why? \"I want to use my computer without random popups accidentally eating my keyboard commands and doing things without my consent\" is not /that/ unreasonable of an ask.",

The only conditions under which focus should change:- I've just launched the application- I've clicked on a window- I've clicked the window's icon in the dock- I've cmd-tabbed (or equivalent) to this window- The currently focused window has produced a modal dialog, that prevents all input events from going into the original window. (Whether and when modal dialogs are OK is debatable.)Matthew 5:37, \"anything more comes from evil\".",

All of these were introduced after 3.0, but have not been considered severe enough to fix.",

Classic example is when you push a fresh branch to Github and they conveniently provide the \"click here to make a PR\" in the push response.I just set my window stealing behavior setting to \"None\" to see if that improves things.I have never had an app (on Linux/KDE) steal my attention inappropriately.

Ads and (extremely clickbaity) 'news' plastered all over W11 are a prime example, and the exact opposite of what the KDE team are doing here.",

The compositor checks if the token is legit and, if so, gives the PDF viewer focus.>If the token is missing, old, or otherwise invalid, the compositor says no.Doesn't seem to go far enough. If this is a long operation and you switch to another app to read a page in a browser, will the opened PDF steal focus from your reading or allow you to switch to PDF at your own leisure?> The viewer window will not get focus, and instead, its icon in the taskbar will start flashing to grab your attention.This is just a common awful alternative.  There is nothing important about this activity to flash, charging the style once would be just fine. But at least it's not jumping up like the UI geniuses at Apple have done.But otherwise, great initiative, focus stealing is a serious UI crime!",
