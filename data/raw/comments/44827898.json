Just take practice tests, and when you get an answer wrong, carefully articulate exactly why each of the wrong answers was wrong and the right answer was correct. At least when I took it (17 years ago now) there was always a clearly right answer and three clearly wrong answers. I’ve never seen a single LSAT where that wasn’t the case. During the test you should be able to not only identify the correct answer, but articulate in your head why each other answer is clearly wrong.",
