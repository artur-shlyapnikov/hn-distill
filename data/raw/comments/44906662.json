The cook at one of the Quarter cafes I'm a regular at lives in a place right across the street, above a magic shop and an art gallery and a bar. Things are dense and intertwingled and weird and exciting.None of that. Just, here's the residential zone, here's the commercial zone, here's the industrial zone.
