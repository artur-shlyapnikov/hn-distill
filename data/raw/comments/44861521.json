My heart leapt with joy when I found an affordable USB-modem dongle and was excited to try it out. TBH the only service I could find was a US-based fax service but that worked really well. Sadly, all the BBSs I'd hoped to try out had long since converted to Telnet, but hey, it was cool to think that if I ever needed to dialup anything I could actually do it",

You just had to be patient the first time while all the graphic assets got cached.Some years later she was on a cell network connection with 128kbps fallback if you go over your limit.  Hey, 4x as fast as she had before, effectively unlimited right?  Wrong.  Bloat was by now such that sites simply wouldn't load at 128kbps.  Things timed out before all the bloat was loaded and you would not get the UI regardless how patient you were.Hacker News still worked of course.",

In the case of loading multiple pages, lazy loading meant this didn't really work. It was a much more brutal experience than the first go around.The worst part was how little actual content actually makes up the bloat. Sure video was right out, but I was often struggling to load pages that were mostly text.The only other option at the time was Hugesnet. After doing the math I determined the data caps were so low dialup was actually cheaper at MBs/month and had less latency issues.

A couple of the clients still offered dial-up internet, so there were a few hundred people with dial up at that point. They were largely people with very rural homes that they didn't even have DSL. They were largely older people. And they just made a steady profit, the equipment and lines basically just worked and they had a FAR lower rate of calls than the DSL, Cable, Fiber, etc customers.",

I eagerly asked all my friends and family to pick up as many aol cds as they can and hand them to me. I missed a couple  crucial details (as an excuse I was quite young): a) CDs are heavy, b) the headquarters aren’t even in Germany so I would have to send the CDs overseas, c) shipping heavy stuff is expensive, d) it’s easier to spread the word to everyone that they should collect stuff for you than it is to tell them to stop.Took me a long while to get rid of all of them.",
