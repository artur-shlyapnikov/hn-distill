You just had to be patient the first time while all the graphic assets got cached.Some years later she was on a cell network connection with 128kbps fallback if you go over your limit.  Hey, 4x as fast as she had before, effectively unlimited right?  Wrong.  Bloat was by now such that sites simply wouldn't load at 128kbps.  Things timed out before all the bloat was loaded and you would not get the UI regardless how patient you were.Hacker News still worked of course.",

Later when I bought a house I was lied to by comcast about availability and ended up dialup again. (My fault for believing them tbh) Most of the tricks I used to make the most out of a dialup connection (disable images, disable flash player, load multiple pages so they could be browsed offline) didn't make a difference anymore. In the case of loading multiple pages, lazy loading meant this didn't really work. It was a much more brutal experience than the first go around.The worst part was how little actual content actually makes up the bloat. Sure video was right out, but I was often struggling to load pages that were mostly text.The only other option at the time was Hugesnet. After doing the math I determined the data caps were so low dialup was actually cheaper at MBs/month and had less latency issues. Realistically the next best available step up wasn't Hughesnet it was shotgunned 56K.",

At first you just got a second or two of sound, and it would add maybe a second on each play.  Eventually the magic of compound interest would get you the whole song, and that was a major adrenaline rush",

    "textPlain": "I had an elderly friend that still subscribed to AOL dialup until he died a couple of years ago. He had built his small business, which was very dependent on email, using an old AOL email address. The type of business he was in could involve old contacts suddenly appearing out of the blue again (via an email message) and so he wanted to maintain the AOL address to not lose that business.Long ago, when AOL stopped requiring an AOL subscription to maintain an AOL email address, I advised him to cancel the AOL subscription. After explaining to me how important that exact address was to him he declined, stating that by paying the monthly fee he felt very assured the email address wouldn't go away and without paying for he felt like that assurance just wasn't there. So for years he knowingly paid for dialup he no longer actually used.",
