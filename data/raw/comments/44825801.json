    "textPlain": "The FAQ answers why this exists when macOS has a similar built-in feature:> Optimized Charging, a feature that is built into MacOS, aims to ensure the longevity and health of your battery. It does so by \"delaying charging the battery past 80% when it predicts that you’ll be plugged in for an extended period of time, and aims to charge the battery before you unplug,\" as explained in Apple's user guide.> Additionally, Optimized Charging uses machine learning to decide when the battery should be held at 80%, and when it should become fully charged. If your Mac is not plugged in on a regular schedule, optimized charging will not work as intended.> This app is a similar alternative to Optimized Charging, giving the user control over when it is activated, what percentage the battery should be held at, and more.",

    "textPlain": "This is awesome!Thanks for explaining the reasoning behind implementing your own version instead of using Al Dente. The straightforward UI is really appealing.I paid for an Al Dente license long ago and have been very happy with it, sail mode and temperature sensitive charging are great features (although I’m not sure how big of an impact sail mode makes).It’s great to see alternatives available though. Having command line access is really cool.",

    "textPlain": "I could swear my MacBook Air M3 was limiting at 80% charge before, but now it's at 100%. I suspect that the latest OS update, 15.6, disabled or removed whatever was limiting it, but I don't remember what that was.It doesn't look like I had installed this \"battery\" command. It might have been AlDente, but I don't find that anywhere either.A puzzler.",

    "textPlain": "Could’ve been the built in optimized battery charging where it stays at 80% until about when it think it’ll be needed (based off of previous usage on battery tmk, but i wouldn’t be surprised if it also looks at the native calendar app or something too) at which point it charges to 100%. Apple has been doing it for years on iPhones and i think it was introduced on Mac when Apple silicon happened.For me my MacBook stays at 80% through the evening and night before charging to 100% in the morning when I typically unplug it and put it in my bag. If you open the battery thing in the menu bar it shows when it’s doing this, the time it’s scheduled to be finished charging by, and has a little button to charge to 100% immediately.",

    "textPlain": "macOS has a built in \"smart\" battery management feature (\"Optimize battery charging\" in system settings -> battery -> battery health) that limits charging to 80% during times when it expects you to have the MacBook plugged in, but charges automatically to 100% when it thinks you'll be using battery power.It's unreliable, however, especially if you don't have your MacBook plugged in on a fixed schedule every day.It's good that there are more third-party tools to work around this long-standing macOS deficiency. I've been using another one, called \"Battery Toolkit\", which has been working well.",

Alternatively, the logic behind that setting may have ‘decided’ that you need 100% charge now (I think this setting isn’t just a “limit charging to 80%” flag, but tries to predict future power demands)",
