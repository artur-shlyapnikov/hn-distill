It’s more important to test how they navigate a large codebase, make reliable changes in line with existing code, not introduce random regressions, be fast, etc.",

    "textPlain": "I am just starting to feel that GPT-5 is more hype.Just a day before GPT-5 launch, I made a video about making a tool with agents, Claude Sonnet 4 and GitHub Copilot.There was so much hype on the launch day - on how good GPT-5 is, how it gets the code right the first time, and how little direction it needs.So I was compelled to try it again with GPT-5 preview available in Copilot.And for some reason, it struggled to align with directions.a. It would make its own decisions, misaligned with what I mentioned. I had to explicitly say \"DO NOT DO this....\". ( explicit instructions were followed.)b. It did not complete tasks and moved forward. This is the same style I used with both GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.Also, it might be good at coding, but it does feel geeky - need to try more.",
