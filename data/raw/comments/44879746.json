    "textPlain": "Do keep in mind.H-1B is for when you cannot find an American to fill a role so somebody comes into the US on a visa to fill that slot.O-1 [1] is a for when somebody non-American has a lot of skill and is allowed to immigrate into the US to perform it.I still think H-1B visas should require some kind of additional fee proportional to training an American to fill that role. Afaik, most of the H-1B visas are just abuse where you hire somebody at a low wage than you'd need to for an otherwise legal resident so there needs to be some kind of higher opportunity cost to the company.[1]: https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary...",

    "textPlain": "> The proposed weighted-selection concept echoes a 2021 DHS plan under President Donald Trump's first administration that had sought to rank and select petitions by wage tiers (OES wage levels IV down to I), an approach that the Trump administration argued would prioritize higher-paid, highly skilled hires. That earlier plan faced opposition, was withdrawn by the Biden administration and saw related regulations blocked in federal court.This seems like a no-brainer. Why did Biden withdraw the rule?",

For example, if you look at FANG, they pay as much for an H1-B as they would pay any other employee. Where is this perspective that you can hire someone at lower wage because they come with H1-B?
