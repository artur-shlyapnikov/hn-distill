It seems to me their stated goals, ie. searching history without remembering keywords or urls, feels well-suited to small LLMs running locally. I think though given the immense security/privacy/censorship concerns regarding AI that this ought to be done a bit more loudly and openly.",

It's obviously not as good as fat commercial models used by e.g Google Translate, but get the point across often enough that I almost stopped using those commercial engines. What's interesting is that this only useful ML service came out from collaboration with several European universities and was mostly an academic project, polished by a commercial interest into a useful service. Makes an interesting comparison with those pipe dreams conjured up by Mozilla business suites that set fire to millions of dollars and ended up with nothing.",
