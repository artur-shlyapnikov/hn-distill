    "textPlain": "Wrong outrage clickbait. It has nothing to do with AI features (edit: in the \"LLM sense\") but comes from the new vector search in the address bar. It was first rolled out to a tiny subset of users with an English Firefox in Great Britian and Canada, x64 and at least 8 GB RAM in Fiefox 141.0.2. This issue has been fixed in Firefox 143. The original source is NeoWin based on a dubious report from Reddit: https://www.neowin.net/news/mozilla-under-fire-for-firefox-a... They now corrected their article:> Update (August 13, 2025, 03:57 GMT): While the community correctly identified a performance issue, their attribution of the cause was mistaken. A Firefox spokesperson provided the following statement, clarifying the situation:> We're working to improve client-side matching in the address bar, which makes it possible for users to recall previously visited websites without remembering exact keywords in the URL or page title.> We unintentionally shipped a performance bug during the phased rollout of this feature, which processes information privately on-device. After receiving reports of issues that hadn't come up in our testing, we reversed the rollout, and the performance issues should be resolved.The article from The Register cites this too but still comes to the wrong conclusion it's for naming tab groups. The author has no idea what he is writing about.",

If I ask it to translate or summarize, I obviously want it done pronto, but otherwise it's almost certainly the case that slower inference that doesn't interrupt anything else is preferable. Since inference is almost always intensive, this seems like table stakes so I can't imagine they did nothing.",

It's obviously not as good as fat commercial models used by e.g Google Translate, but get the point across often enough that I almost stopped using those commercial engines. What's interesting is that this only useful ML service came out from collaboration with several European universities and was mostly an academic project, polished by a commercial interest into a useful service. Makes an interesting comparison with those pipe dreams conjured up by Mozilla business suites that set fire to millions of dollars and ended up with nothing.",
