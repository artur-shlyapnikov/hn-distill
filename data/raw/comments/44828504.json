    "textPlain": "Kevin Mitnick figured out how to get around police radio encryption in the 90's. From 'Ghost in the Wires':\n\"Whenever I heard any hiss of communication, I’d hold down my Transmit button. That would send\nout a radio signal on the same exact frequency, which would jam the signal.\nThen the second agent wouldn’t be able to hear the first agent’s transmission. After two or three tries back and forth, the agents would get\nfrustrated with the radio. I could imagine one of them saying something like, “Something’s wrong with the radio. Let’s go in the clear.”\nThey’d throw a switch on their radios to take them out of encryption mode, and I’d be able to hear both sides of the conversation! Even today\nI’m amused to remember how easy it was to work around that encryption without even cracking the code.\"",

    "textPlain": "For anyone who's curious, the closest equivalent in the US is P25[1] or \"Project 25\". And if you're wondering, yes, P25 systems have been known to have their own share of vulnerabilities of various sorts. My favorite one[2] is the one that lets an attacker force a P25 radio to broadcast tokens \"on demand\" allow you to (theoretically, with the right receiving setup and software) track the location of P25 radios more or less in real-time.And on a related note, for anyone who is interested in listening in on any local P25 transmissions, you can do so in a fairly inexpensive manner, using an RTL-SDR dongle and the Open Source op25[3] software package. No listening to encrypted traffic, but IME, many (maybe most) public safety agencies keep most of their traffic in the clear. More so for fire/ems traffic. Law enforcement is more likely to be encrypted, but even then, I find that many jurisdictions only encrypt a small number of channels, like maybe a dedicated vice/narc squad channel, SWAT team channel, etc. General LE dispatch and tac channels are still in the clear in many areas.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_25[2]: https://www.reddit.com/r/tacticalgear/comments/1f4d5dr/psa_p...[3]: https://github.com/boatbod/op25",
