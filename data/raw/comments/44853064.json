    "textPlain": "Nice!As an aside, while this tool can be used to create an audiobook from a book you have in text format, for your private consumption, having an author employ something like this to create files for distribution is extremely risky, even if they acknowledge its use and intend those files to only be available on their website.Indie authors struggle a lot to promote their works, and the new normal is that potential readers, the polite ones[^1], use the slightest hint of AI usage to discard their title and move on...as they are entitled to, since there are so many books.I in particular have started to hire voice actors that have good acting skills and good diction but for whom English is their second language, or it's their first language but they speak something else at home; sometimes I even ask them to go a notch up with their accents. It helps with the non-AI recognition, and it also increases the appeal of the book for people who would like to try out something new. Once, I did an audition for a project and was pleasantly surprised with how much life people from around the Mediterranean basin were able to inject into their renderings, compared with people from Britain and North America.[^1] Impolite readers set the town on fire, and then go about and spread that fire to neighboring towns, for good measure.",

Well done!I tried a PDF and the UI to select pages or sections is good and generation is fast on my laptop's GTX 1650.The result is an .ogg audio and .ass subtitle file.  Played with mpv allows listening and reading along in the terminal.  Only issue I have with the result is that visual line breaks from the PDF are preserved resulting in long pauses \"randomly\" in the middle of sentences.  This greatly interrupts understanding of the audio.Edit: enabling the skipping of single newlines helps!",

This produces unusable audiobooks for me. I'm working on \"vibe coding\" my own Kokoro based tkinter personal gui app for the same purpise that uses nltk and some regex magic for better splitting.",
