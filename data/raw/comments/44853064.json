The model is fast and delivers impressive quality for its small size. Some issues I have faced, however, are:\na) It doesn't distinguish periods at the end of sentences from the dots in abbreviations such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" The result is an awkward pause between \"Mr.\" and the name.\nb) It doesn't handle ellipses well.\nc) Words are pronounced the same way regardless of context.",
