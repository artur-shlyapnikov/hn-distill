    "textPlain": "Hi!I've been trying to write 'the next post' for the last 5 years - it's often something I think about that I've just left these posts in the ether with no conclusion. It wasn't a conscious decision not to continue, but I started interviewing then got hired at an early stage start up (Tailscale), and everything turned into a blur. When I went back to the draft I had going, it felt overwhelming to try condense the pace at which my skills and career was evolving and I'd close it pretty quickly. Surprisingly to me, it's been more than just how I write code thats evolved - I've discovered a lot about how I operate within a tech company and that I'm also extremely user focused.I'm not sure how my blog was found and posted here (but thank you for reading!), but last night I did open that draft and started working on it again. A complete coincidence, but it was the first time it felt like I'm in the right space to continue working on it and distilling the past 4.5 years of employment, the initial job search, etc. As someone mentioned, I left my previous role recently, but I'm starting the next adventure on Monday. Now seems like a good time to finish that post!Charlotte",

    "textPlain": "Doing it professionally destroyed all the magic for me. Everything is slop, customer appointments are exhausting af, nobody is able to precisely communicate their needs and im supposed to be the people pleaser saying \"sure can do\" to every lunatic idea some person with enough money has. If you want to take responsibility and actually build a valuable product your only option is open source software as companies, no matter the size, do not care about the nuances a feature might have as long as its shippable. Big tech has embarked into enshittification for over two decades now. Imagine being paid for making a product worse. Fuck this industry, money is the only driver for me. Once that's gone, which surely will happen with companies trying to replace devs with AI, I'll hopefully find a way to keep my income stable in a different profession that is actually enjoyable.",
