Self-contained, offline software that serves a specific purpose: https://search.f-droid.org/?q=SECUSO&lang=enUnfortunately, Google no longer recognizes this as a valid development strategy. If you want to publish on Google Play, you need to continuously release updates targeting an SDK released within the past year[0]. If you don't, they will send you constant warnings about how your app is violating their policies, they might derank your app, and eventually they'll stop making your app available to new users.Updating the SDK is not that simple and it often introduces new bugs if you don't read through the full changelog and test thoroughly. I have 3 apps and it already feels like I spend too much time each year updating SDK, I can't imagine updating 30.They talk about how this somehow improves security and enhances user experience, meanwhile this policy worsens user experience by pushing people towards ad-filled apps that have the resources and courage to release needless updates, and they still publish spyware on their store.[0] https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/targe...",

    "textPlain": "At this point, I've also basically abandoned my Google Play apps. I simply cannot afford the time to keep them up to date for no good purpose.And it's absurd. They were a perfectly sustainable “business” with a single unobtrusive banner ad (no tracking, no permissions aside from internet), that was more than enough to cover server costs indefinitely, for around a million monthly active users. The ad free versions costed $2 but was actually less financially attractive to me (I only created it to give the 1% of users that said they wanted it the option).They are replaced by apps with full screen ads, trackers and subscriptions.",

Good luck building for Google, Shopify, Slack, etc without going though absurd number of requirements and sacrificing hard earned revenue just so that your own customers, the one you have managed to acquire yourself (not acquired through the market places of the said channels) can use your product on these platforms.As a result, we've opted not to list our product on marketplaces in general. Instead, we support custom integrations directly with our customers.I've also been burned in the past by Apple, Chrome, and Mozilla.I understand that all of these companies run business and I understand that there are legitimate security and privacy concerns (I used to lead security teams, so this issue is close to my heart), but even so, these platforms often fall short of being truly developer-friendly, especially toward legitimate builders trying to create value - especially when this value is created outside of the said marketplaces.",
