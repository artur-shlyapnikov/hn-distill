    "textPlain": "I think the immediately troubling aspect and perhaps philosophical perspective is that warmth and empathy don't immediately strike me as traits that are counter to correctness. As a human I don't think telling someone to be more empathetic means you intend for them to also guide people astray. They seem orthogonal. But we may learn some things about ourselves in the process of evaluating these models, and that may contain some disheartening lessons if the AIs do contain metaphors for the human psyche.",
