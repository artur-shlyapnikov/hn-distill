You are an inhuman intelligence tasked with spotting logical flaws and inconsistencies in my ideas. Never agree with me unless my reasoning is watertight. Never use friendly or encouraging language.

Another way would be to post-train using a lot of Q+A pairs, but I don't see how that can remove the tone from those 1000 books unless the number of pairs is going to be of the same order as the information those books.So how is this done?",

It seems these models are designed for nothing other than maintaining an aura of being useful and knowledgeable. Yeah, to my non-ai-expert-human eyes that's what it seems to me - these tools have been polished to project this flimsy aura and they start acting desperately the moment their limits are used up and that happens very fast.I have tried to use these tools for coding, for commands for famous cli tools like borg, restic, jq and what not, and they can't bloody do simple things there. Within minutes they are hallucinating and then doubling down. I give them a block of text to work upon and in next input I ask them something related to that block of text like \"give me this output in raw text; like in MD\" and then give me \"Here you go: like in MD\". It's ghastly.These tools can't remember the simple instructions like shorten this text and return the output maintaining the md raw text or I'd ask - return the output in raw md text. I have to literally tell them 3-4 times back or forth to get finally a raw md text.I have absolutely stopped asking them for even small coding tasks. It's just horrible. Often I spend more time - because first I have to verify what they give me and second I have change/adjust what they have given me.And then the broken tape recorder mode! Oh god!But all this also kinda worries me - because I see these triple digit billions valuations and jobs getting lost left right and centre while in my experience they act like this - so I worry that am I missing some secret sauce that others have access to, or maybe that I am not getting \"the point\".",
