    "textPlain": "I've just about got my 1981 Mini I bought in highschool for $600 NZD back in one piece. Wasn't going to touch the engine originally but thought why not, so almost 20 years later with almost everything aside from the shell refurbed or replaced here we are. It's been expensive and slow and I'd have been better off now having put the money into a house deposit instead. But now I know a fair amount about rebuilding a 45 year old car and I have about 10k in specialty tools I will probably barely use again, so I guess there's that.",

That's from here.[1] For $4699 you can buy a copy of the full report.The market size estimate may come from defining a rather large range of cars as \"classic\". The average auction price of a \"classic car\" is $45,000.[2] Not sure what definition they're using, but we're not talking about what goes to Pebble Beach.[1] https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/classic-cars-market[2] https://www.classic.com/insights/hagerty-2025-market-in-4-ch...",
