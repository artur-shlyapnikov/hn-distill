    "textPlain": "People basically want a life coach, someone by their side who can tell them what the best next thing to do is at any given moment. Everything else are just approximation of that ideal.The author's .txt file works because its simplicity forces a daily ritual of self-coaching. The tool demands that the user manually review, prioritize, and decide what matters. There are no features to hide behind, only the discipline of the process itself.The impulse to use complex apps or build custom scripts is the attempt to engineer a better coach. We try to automate the prioritization and reminders, hoping the system can do the coaching for us.The great trap, of course, is when we fall in love with engineering the system instead of doing the work. This turns productivity into a sophisticated form of procrastination.Ultimately, the best system is the one that removes the most friction between decision and action. For the author, that meant stripping away everything but the list itself.",

    "textPlain": "Reading through the comments under this thread, there are many users who swear by a plain text file, but who then build quite a lot of snowflake software to regain functionality offered by more structured TODO applications. That includes:- having your computer alert you to things that come up- being able to tag notes- being able to add events to a calendar- being able to set priority of tasks- expecting prioritized/currently relevant tasks to be at the top of the agenda- being able to add recurring tasks- full-text search (grepping)- formatting features (markdown)Some of the laborious (or, in my opinion, plain unholy) solutions include:- feeding TODOs to an LLM to filter for the currently relevant ones and send Telegram notifications- hand-copying currently relevant tasks to the top of the TODO list- running a script on a VPS to sync notifications- set up cron job with git commit- writing post-it notes by handI would encourage everyone to try out emacs with org-mode. It takes some time to get used to the editor and its keybindings (though provisions exist for vim users), but _every_ item on the list above is handled out of the box, or is offered through a free and maintained plugin.The author of the OP claims to have tried _every_ todo app, and has afterwards moved (regressed?) to writing notes in a plain text file, but there is a path extending from this point that the author has not walked yet. I strongly suggest that, especially for people with a computing or technical background, it is an undisputed upgrade. https://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html being the bible, of course.",

There was a SHOW HN too [2]. Yes, shameless plug.

    "textPlain": "There was a period in my life when, just like OP, I tried many TODO apps. With each new app that I tried, I was filled with immense expectation that this finally is the app that will help me get my life in order. Needless to say, the early high was soon filled with inevitable dread, as the items and lists in the app kept on growing and I struggled to keep up with the brutal requirements of life as it is.There were certain apps which would give the user a lot of options to customize the lists and the items in them. Customize in ways that would make the TODO item the most unique TODO item in its requirement and its quality. Such apps made me think a lot. Or should I say, overthink a lot. I would spend a lot of time trying to find the ultimate, most specific, custom setting for a TODO item that would make it unique and give it a life of its own. Looking back now, I am not sure how useful it all was. Ultimately, I ended up doing some items and not doing others. I cannot quantify what additional  productivity they brought to me.Now I dont use any TODO app at all. I just try to remember things, and I don't feel any different from the time when I was using those apps. Makes me wonder! Was I trying to invent a problem so that I could use these apps as a solution.Perhaps that's why so many people come back to the old plain paper or a simple text file approach. Perhaps we all realize that it was perhaps not a problem after all and we would still have achieved most of what we set out to do. And even if we didn't, in the end, it doesn't matter all that much because life still goes on regardless.",

I also don't go through organizing my files that much either.inbox.org is just a great place to dump anything, so I usually do a quick scan and either delete everything or refine it to the backlog.org.For backlog.org, I'll usually just let things sit there and build up.

I can freely grep anything, I can quickly create a sprint summary from the tagged files, etc. I can back up or sync with git or any other software that works with plain text files and folders.This is very simple and hacky, but haven't had to touch for years and it works for me - only me, only on my laptop, I don't need it on mobile.

Instead of Ctrl+F, I use grep. The format is Markdown.My typical TODO file has 3 sections: TODO, Pending, and DONE. If something is done for the day, I move it to the DONE section. When I create a new file for a new day, I copy over everything except the DONE section. The Pending section is for something I can't act on immediately (say, waiting for a coworker's response). I look there less often.Every morning I also re-prioritize the items in the TODO section.The only problem is that if I'm away from the work computer, I have to add items in a separate app on the phone (Notepad Free) and then manually copy them to the PC.This system is something I naturally came to over those 7 years via trial and error, something that works well for me.

    "textPlain": "After trying text files and other apps, I wrote my own about ten years ago and have been using it ever since. ( https://famplan.io - I'm starting to turn it into something other people might use.)I tend to agree with the idea that simpler is better, but a single text file wasn't quite enough. I like being able to see my lists on multiple devices, I tend to like to have multiple lists for different purposes, and it's also very useful to have shared lists for coordinating with my family and others.The experience of using this has taught me a few things about how to use these lists effectively:1. Using a list is like writing a journal - you need to be intentional about explicitly working to make it part of your routine. (Part of this is committing to record tasks that need to be done and then committing in some explicit way to actually doing those things.)2. It needs to be fast, it needs to be easy, and it needs to be present. Anything else gets in the way of point 1.3. It's important to track when you need/want to do, but lists of things to do can be overwhelming. (It's useful to have at least a few ways to ignore items when you can't or don't want to deal with them. I handle this by having multiple lists, and also having a snooze feature to ignore items for a while.)4. You need to have a way to handle items or tasks that go on for a while. (You need to make a call, but have to leave a message, and are waiting for a callback... etc. These are places where you need to take action to push something along, but the action doesn't result in a complete task, so you need to revisit it later.)This is going to sound odd coming from someone who wrote a tool for the purpose, but the key here is really to pick a system (any system) and then actually use it. Spend too much time developing the system, then all you've done is give yourself something else to do.",

A TODO form of note is about as flexible as Redis, and so the use-cases are many, from quick writes/reads (i.e. jotting down TODOs) to sortedset (i.e. priority list TODOs) to full task management (i.e. more data in the value), and everything inbetween.In the same way we build around Redis for whatever tasks we need, you see engineers build around the concept of the note, complaining every other solution isn't exactly what they're using it for, and they're right, because on the other end is another engineer building for their niche use pattern.By unpacking the use cases and slicing the right niches there might be a better notes app product somewhere, but I think it takes a very strong product person, not an engineer, to figure that out.",

I usually plan between 1.5 and 2x the amount of todo I'm actually capable of doing, because I like stretch goals. Then I spend the week working on the todos.

I also built automation to spice things up a little and ask me to get a privacy review on some of the items, or to start the process on those todos again because I forgot a step or something.I start every day with a 1/2h to 1h meeting where I explain what I didn't do the day before, and what I won't do today either because I'm blocked for some reason. I used to do it with my dog but nowadays I use copilot chat because its reassuring tone gives me the impression that it matters.At the end of the week I put back the todos I didn't do in the backlog.
