    "textPlain": "Reading through the comments under this thread, there are many users who swear by a plain text file, but who then build quite a lot of snowflake software to regain functionality offered by more structured TODO applications. That includes:- having your computer alert you to things that come up- being able to tag notes- being able to add events to a calendar- being able to set priority of tasks- expecting prioritized/currently relevant tasks to be at the top of the agenda- being able to add recurring tasks- full-text search (grepping)- formatting features (markdown)Some of the laborious (or, in my opinion, plain unholy) solutions include:- feeding TODOs to an LLM to filter for the currently relevant ones and send Telegram notifications- hand-copying currently relevant tasks to the top of the TODO list- running a script on a VPS to sync notifications- set up cron job with git commit- writing post-it notes by handI would encourage everyone to try out emacs with org-mode. It takes some time to get used to the editor and its keybindings (though provisions exist for vim users), but _every_ item on the list above is handled out of the box, or is offered through a free and maintained plugin.The author of the OP claims to have tried _every_ todo app, and has afterwards moved (regressed?) to writing notes in a plain text file, but there is a path extending from this point that the author has not walked yet. I strongly suggest that, especially for people with a computing or technical background, it is an undisputed upgrade. https://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html being the bible, of course.",

    "textPlain": "There was a period in my life when, just like OP, I tried many TODO apps. With each new app that I tried, I was filled with immense expectation that this finally is the app that will help me get my life in order. Needless to say, the early high was soon filled with inevitable dread, as the items and lists in the app kept on growing and I struggled to keep up with the brutal requirements of life as it is.There were certain apps which would give the user a lot of options to customize the lists and the items in them. Customize in ways that would make the TODO item the most unique TODO item in its requirement and its quality. Such apps made me think a lot. Or should I say, overthink a lot. I would spend a lot of time trying to find the ultimate, most specific, custom setting for a TODO item that would make it unique and give it a life of its own. Looking back now, I am not sure how useful it all was. Ultimately, I ended up doing some items and not doing others. I cannot quantify what additional  productivity they brought to me.Now I dont use any TODO app at all. I just try to remember things, and I don't feel any different from the time when I was using those apps. Makes me wonder! Was I trying to invent a problem so that I could use these apps as a solution.Perhaps that's why so many people come back to the old plain paper or a simple text file approach. Perhaps we all realize that it was perhaps not a problem after all and we would still have achieved most of what we set out to do. And even if we didn't, in the end, it doesn't matter all that much because life still goes on regardless.",

I have a bug tracker that’s used to track larger items (everyone uses the same tool), but it’s not a personal todo list in a more granular sense.- Reminders app on the iPhone. I use this just so I don’t forget to do things that aren’t naturally top of mind. Or, at least things that should become a priority, but only at a later point. And I don’t have many times that I need these. Maybe a few times a month, and a few recurring ones.But other than this, if it’s really that important, I’ll remember it anyway. And if I don’t, and it’s not tracked with a bug (work) or reminder (home), it’s not that important.So unless you count the occasional use of the Reminders app, or our work bug tracker tool, then I’m currently not using any todo lists, and it’s been working fine.",

I usually plan between 1.5 and 2x the amount of todo I'm actually capable of doing, because I like stretch goals. Then I spend the week working on the todos. I built an automation that sends me messages to ask why such and such todos are not moving fast enough. I also built automation to spice things up a little and ask me to get a privacy review on some of the items, or to start the process on those todos again because I forgot a step or something.I start every day with a 1/2h to 1h meeting where I explain what I didn't do the day before, and what I won't do today either because I'm blocked for some reason. I used to do it with my dog but nowadays I use copilot chat because its reassuring tone gives me the impression that it matters.At the end of the week I put back the todos I didn't do in the backlog.

    "textPlain": "After trying text files and other apps, I wrote my own about ten years ago and have been using it ever since. ( https://famplan.io - I'm starting to turn it into something other people might use.)I tend to agree with the idea that simpler is better, but a single text file wasn't quite enough. I like being able to see my lists on multiple devices, I tend to like to have multiple lists for different purposes, and it's also very useful to have shared lists for coordinating with my family and others.The experience of using this has taught me a few things about how to use these lists effectively:1. Using a list is like writing a journal - you need to be intentional about explicitly working to make it part of your routine. (Part of this is committing to record tasks that need to be done and then committing in some explicit way to actually doing those things.)2. It needs to be fast, it needs to be easy, and it needs to be present. Anything else gets in the way of point 1.3. It's important to track when you need/want to do, but lists of things to do can be overwhelming. (It's useful to have at least a few ways to ignore items when you can't or don't want to deal with them. I handle this by having multiple lists, and also having a snooze feature to ignore items for a while.)4. You need to have a way to handle items or tasks that go on for a while. (You need to make a call, but have to leave a message, and are waiting for a callback... etc. These are places where you need to take action to push something along, but the action doesn't result in a complete task, so you need to revisit it later.)This is going to sound odd coming from someone who wrote a tool for the purpose, but the key here is really to pick a system (any system) and then actually use it. Spend too much time developing the system, then all you've done is give yourself something else to do.",

Is this why Apple notes has such a following, since it's not a monetized product of apple?- Is the allure of plain text the fact that it doesn't change, analogous to something written on paper?",

However, the vacation came and I wasn't really keen on dragging the book everywhere. Additionally i noticed that while planning, I don't really respect my long term goals - so I build an app for that: Simple thing that does several thing: \n- 1. Keep only 5 slots for most important tasks. \n- 2. Have calendar view in the same view (like google tasks) to make sure that I havent' forgotten some important meeting\n- 3. (Unlike google tasks, or clickup) - have short-term and  long term goals in the same view , to make sure that every important task is related to long term goal\n- Bonus: I see stats on how much of important tasks I have completed. Goal is at least 80% avg for 7 days. \n- Bonus2: I've added my values to make sure that these are not forgotten in other places.So single view to address todays work and relate it to long term vision.
