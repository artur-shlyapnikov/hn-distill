    "textPlain": "Reading through the comments under this thread, there are many users who swear by a plain text file, but who then build quite a lot of snowflake software to regain functionality offered by more structured TODO applications. That includes:- having your computer alert you to things that come up- being able to tag notes- being able to add events to a calendar- being able to set priority of tasks- expecting prioritized/currently relevant tasks to be at the top of the agenda- being able to add recurring tasks- full-text search (grepping)- formatting features (markdown)Some of the laborious (or, in my opinion, plain unholy) solutions include:- feeding TODOs to an LLM to filter for the currently relevant ones and send Telegram notifications- hand-copying currently relevant tasks to the top of the TODO list- running a script on a VPS to sync notifications- set up cron job with git commit- writing post-it notes by handI would encourage everyone to try out emacs with org-mode. It takes some time to get used to the editor and its keybindings (though provisions exist for vim users), but _every_ item on the list above is handled out of the box, or is offered through a free and maintained plugin.The author of the OP claims to have tried _every_ todo app, and has afterwards moved (regressed?) to writing notes in a plain text file, but there is a path extending from this point that the author has not walked yet. I strongly suggest that, especially for people with a computing or technical background, it is an undisputed upgrade. https://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html being the bible, of course.",

Up to a (very small) point.What the author describes as their “workload” barely registers.For context, for me, Things on any given day has over 100 individual actions, most of which are recurring.By doing this, I can stay on top of an extremely broad surface area. There is no way a text file can handle the number of parallel work streams my (or really many) people have.Broadly, for me these work stream are:* Self Care* Relationship* Children  * Special Needs (IEP, SSI, Conservatorship, GGRC, Medical, Special Needs Trust, etc)\n\n* Friends* Professional (BD, etc)* Investments (Real Estate, Angel Investments, SEP, etc)* Legal (LLCs, Litigation, Wills, etc)* Financial (Quarterly and Annual Taxes in 2 countries, Insurance, etc)* Home (Massive)* Hobbies* VehiclesWithout a serious amount of structure in the form of my todo system, there’s no way a person could manage this - certainly not with a text file.Calendars very rapidly fall down for scheduled tasks that you can’t knock out the day of, they lack reminder functions, etc.",

I feel that many others have similar experiences but I'm not exactly sure why. Like the author, I too ended up with a plain text format (org-mode) and I've happily been on it for 7 years. Some questions that came to mind:- Is it the artificial hype and promises around certain productivity apps (e.g. youtube notion promoters) that ultimately leave one disappointed?- Does the productization of these apps make the companies feel compelled to change too much, thus alienating users? Is this why Apple notes has such a following, since it's not a monetized product of apple?- Is the allure of plain text the fact that it doesn't change, analogous to something written on paper?",

I also don't go through organizing my files that much either.inbox.org is just a great place to dump anything, so I usually do a quick scan and either delete everything or refine it to the backlog.org.For backlog.org, I'll usually just let things sit there and build up. After a while I'll realize that if something has been there for a long time, it probably isn't worth doing - or I already did it, so I delete it.[0]: https://orgmode.org/[1]: https://www.beorgapp.com/[2]: https://hamberg.no/gtd",

Many people would benefit from having a \"living\" app that is personalized to their tastes, and also adapts over time as the characteristics of your life change (e.g. having kids is probably going to change your approach to productivity!)I recommend finding a framework within which to build your own apps, and then building your own suite of apps that have exactly the features you want (shameless plug, I built a platform that can serve as such a framework : WebWidgets.io.  It is basically a way to hook up SQLite databases to JS objects in the browser, which allows wide liberty to build your own simple custom apps).",

    "textPlain": "After trying text files and other apps, I wrote my own about ten years ago and have been using it ever since. ( https://famplan.io - I'm starting to turn it into something other people might use.)I tend to agree with the idea that simpler is better, but a single text file wasn't quite enough. I like being able to see my lists on multiple devices, I tend to like to have multiple lists for different purposes, and it's also very useful to have shared lists for coordinating with my family and others.The experience of using this has taught me a few things about how to use these lists effectively:1. Using a list is like writing a journal - you need to be intentional about explicitly working to make it part of your routine. (Part of this is committing to record tasks that need to be done and then committing in some explicit way to actually doing those things.)2. It needs to be fast, it needs to be easy, and it needs to be present. Anything else gets in the way of point 1.3. It's important to track when you need/want to do, but lists of things to do can be overwhelming. (It's useful to have at least a few ways to ignore items when you can't or don't want to deal with them. I handle this by having multiple lists, and also having a snooze feature to ignore items for a while.)4. You need to have a way to handle items or tasks that go on for a while. (You need to make a call, but have to leave a message, and are waiting for a callback... etc. These are places where you need to take action to push something along, but the action doesn't result in a complete task, so you need to revisit it later.)This is going to sound odd coming from someone who wrote a tool for the purpose, but the key here is really to pick a system (any system) and then actually use it. Spend too much time developing the system, then all you've done is give yourself something else to do.",

    "textPlain": "I've had a plain TODO.txt file for over 20 years so I agree with all the benefits the author mentioned.  However, I don't like it because without an app, there's no runtime loop to notify and alert me of what's coming up.This means I don't have \"ambient awareness\" of what's going on unless... I open the TODO.txt file ... manually scan it... then rescan it again and again multiple times per day.  It's really tedious and inefficient to manually re-read the same items again.  Offloading repetition like that is what computers are good for.  I just don't have a good app at the moment to turn my TODO.txt into something I don't have to manually eyeball all the time.So even though I have a tasks in my TODO.txt, a lot of things still falls through the cracks because I forget I need to do them.If you have the type of brain that has a built-in \"6th sense\" of tasks that need to get done, a lightweight-no-runtime TODO.TXT will work fine for you.  But it's definitely inadequate for me and I need to fix that.EDIT replies to \"use calendar for reminders\" :  Yes, that's a workaround but I've resisted doing that because I wanted the utopia of my TODO.TXT file being the Single-Source-Of-Truth instead of manually copying items to Google Calendar.  (Yes, I know that \"perfection is the enemy of the good\" and all that.)  The way other people do it is they make Google Calendar itself the SSOT.  But that defeats the purpose of the freeform flexibility of the TODO.TXT that has all the notes, etc in addition to tasks.I want my TODO.TXT to be a unified view of everything I want to do in life and splitting some items off into Google Calendar is just more digital housekeeping I wanted to avoid.The way I'd prefer to use Google Calendar is via the developer API to programmatically add entries that's based off of my TODO.TXT.  E.g. : (https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/...)... but that requires an active runtime loop ... like a Python script constantly scanning my TODO.TXT a",
