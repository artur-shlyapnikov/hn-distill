    "textPlain": "I've been back and forth on that topic, going to paper and back to a todo manager of some sort.For the past few years I've been using obsidian for all my note taking, and none of the extensions I tried did what I wanted, so I built myself one[^1]. The initial goal was to take todos right within my notes, so I could keep the context of what the todo was about. Then I started adding stuff like planification and tagging. So it's entirely text based, but with a planner UI on top of it that makes it easy to drag and drop stuff to when I want to do them, and plan my day accordingly.I think the more you go, the more you get set in your own ways, the harder it is to tag along on someone else's implementation of a system.Low tech like paper and text files are good because they're maleable, and dont embed stuff you don't actually need.^1: https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=proletarian-wizard",

    "textPlain": "Reading through the comments under this thread, there are many users who swear by a plain text file, but who then build quite a lot of snowflake software to regain functionality offered by more structured TODO applications. That includes:- having your computer alert you to things that come up- being able to tag notes- being able to add events to a calendar- being able to set priority of tasks- expecting prioritized/currently relevant tasks to be at the top of the agenda- being able to add recurring tasks- full-text search (grepping)- formatting features (markdown)Some of the laborious (or, in my opinion, plain unholy) solutions include:- feeding TODOs to an LLM to filter for the currently relevant ones and send Telegram notifications- hand-copying currently relevant tasks to the top of the TODO list- running a script on a VPS to sync notifications- set up cron job with git commit- writing post-it notes by handI would encourage everyone to try out emacs with org-mode. It takes some time to get used to the editor and its keybindings (though provisions exist for vim users), but _every_ item on the list above is handled out of the box, or is offered through a free and maintained plugin.The author of the OP claims to have tried _every_ todo app, and has afterwards moved (regressed?) to writing notes in a plain text file, but there is a path extending from this point that the author has not walked yet. I strongly suggest that, especially for people with a computing or technical background, it is an undisputed upgrade. https://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html being the bible, of course.",

Up to a (very small) point.What the author describes as their “workload” barely registers.For context, for me, Things on any given day has over 100 individual actions, most of which are recurring.By doing this, I can stay on top of an extremely broad surface area. There is no way a text file can handle the number of parallel work streams my (or really many) people have.Broadly, for me these work stream are:* Self Care* Relationship* Children  * Special Needs (IEP, SSI, Conservatorship, GGRC, Medical, Special Needs Trust, etc)\n\n* Friends* Professional (BD, etc)* Investments (Real Estate, Angel Investments, SEP, etc)* Legal (LLCs, Litigation, Wills, etc)* Financial (Quarterly and Annual Taxes in 2 countries, Insurance, etc)* Home (Massive)* Hobbies* VehiclesWithout a serious amount of structure in the form of my todo system, there’s no way a person could manage this - certainly not with a text file.Calendars very rapidly fall down for scheduled tasks that you can’t knock out the day of, they lack reminder functions, etc.",

I also don't go through organizing my files that much either.inbox.org is just a great place to dump anything, so I usually do a quick scan and either delete everything or refine it to the backlog.org.For backlog.org, I'll usually just let things sit there and build up. After a while I'll realize that if something has been there for a long time, it probably isn't worth doing - or I already did it, so I delete it.[0]: https://orgmode.org/[1]: https://www.beorgapp.com/[2]: https://hamberg.no/gtd",

Many people would benefit from having a \"living\" app that is personalized to their tastes, and also adapts over time as the characteristics of your life change (e.g. having kids is probably going to change your approach to productivity!)I recommend finding a framework within which to build your own apps, and then building your own suite of apps that have exactly the features you want (shameless plug, I built a platform that can serve as such a framework : WebWidgets.io.  It is basically a way to hook up SQLite databases to JS objects in the browser, which allows wide liberty to build your own simple custom apps).",

I feel that many others have similar experiences but I'm not exactly sure why. Like the author, I too ended up with a plain text format (org-mode) and I've happily been on it for 7 years. Some questions that came to mind:- Is it the artificial hype and promises around certain productivity apps (e.g. youtube notion promoters) that ultimately leave one disappointed?- Does the productization of these apps make the companies feel compelled to change too much, thus alienating users? Is this why Apple notes has such a following, since it's not a monetized product of apple?- Is the allure of plain text the fact that it doesn't change, analogous to something written on paper?",

( https://famplan.io - I'm starting to turn it into something other people might use.)I tend to agree with the idea that simpler is better, but a single text file wasn't quite enough. I like being able to see my lists on multiple devices, I tend to like to have multiple lists for different purposes, and it's also very useful to have shared lists for coordinating with my family and others.The experience of using this has taught me a few things about how to use these lists effectively:1. Using a list is like writing a journal - you need to be intentional about explicitly working to make it part of your routine. (Part of this is committing to record tasks that need to be done and then committing in some explicit way to actually doing those things.)2. It needs to be fast, it needs to be easy, and it needs to be present. Anything else gets in the way of point 1.3. It's important to track when you need/want to do, but lists of things to do can be overwhelming. (It's useful to have at least a few ways to ignore items when you can't or don't want to deal with them. I handle this by having multiple lists, and also having a snooze feature to ignore items for a while.)4. You need to have a way to handle items or tasks that go on for a while. (You need to make a call, but have to leave a message, and are waiting for a callback... etc. These are places where you need to take action to push something along, but the action doesn't result in a complete task, so you need to revisit it later.)This is going to sound odd coming from someone who wrote a tool for the purpose, but the key here is really to pick a system (any system) and then actually use it. Spend too much time developing the system, then all you've done is give yourself something else to do.",
