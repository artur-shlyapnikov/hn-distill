    "textPlain": "Tove Jansson, author of the Moomins, also illustrated \"The Hobbit\" in the 1960s.Her version turned out controversial because Gollum is a giant compared to Bilbo. Turns out Tolkien hadn't described Gollum's size anywhere, and the author actually reworded future editions of the book to make it clear that Gollum is a small creature.You can see the image here:https://www.thepopverse.com/jrr-tolkien-the-hobbit-tove-jans...In my opinion Jansson's \"Hobbit\" is a great interpretation by a legendary artist, and this Gollum controversy has overshadowed it too much.The Soviet 1970s version (the OP link here) has an obvious debt to Jansson's illustrations, but the style is much more conventional and stiff. Jansson's linework and compositions are exquisite.",
