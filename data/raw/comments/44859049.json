    "textPlain": "Tove Jansson, author of the Moomins, also illustrated \"The Hobbit\" in the 1960s.Her version turned out controversial because Gollum is a giant compared to Bilbo. Turns out Tolkien hadn't described Gollum's size anywhere, and the author actually reworded future editions of the book to make it clear that Gollum is a small creature.You can see the image here:https://www.thepopverse.com/jrr-tolkien-the-hobbit-tove-jans...In my opinion Jansson's \"Hobbit\" is a great interpretation by a legendary artist, and this Gollum controversy has overshadowed it too much.The Soviet 1970s version (the OP link here) has an obvious debt to Jansson's illustrations, but the style is much more conventional and stiff. Jansson's linework and compositions are exquisite.",

Decades later, having seen the Peter Jackson films several times, Bilbo still looks wrong to me as I expect Leonov; Gollum looks wrong too for that matter.",

Even in the Lord of the Rings (as distinct from\nThe Hobbit) they’d gotten a bit more animalistic IIRC (then again, I need to reread the books, this might be colored by the movies).",
