    "textPlain": "It's rather interesting that California is having it's coolest summer in decades. In the valley, it's been high 80's, low 90's with only a couple days so far that were 100+. Typically in the valley it's 100+ nearly every day of summer.I wonder what impact that may have on wildfire season this year.",
