    "textPlain": "That¬†looks very cool. I wonder how hard it was to get those printed keycaps made.Ideally you want access to everything without moving your hands off the keyboard. The DIY keyboard scene makes a lot of use of layered keymaps. It seems like the endgame for this kind of thing is not separate \"keypads,\" but rather wider support, standardisation and adoption of multiple-layer keymaps. Half the problem is designing good maps and the other half is learning them. Sharing maps, and better software for learning/practicing the maps would help. Then you might need a few more keys to select layers. A minimum implementation might be adding a two thumb buttons below the space bar to select layers.EDIT: inserted more text",

    "textPlain": "$140, lol.  How¬†about just selling the keycaps for an existing numeric pad or even small mech keyboard, and that's only if the physical keys are really needed.The main slowdown I face as an occasional TeX user is remembering the TeX names of less frequently used symbols.  For that purpose there is detexify (draw the character and find the name, doesn't work all that well) but a popup graphical menu or (if you must) a phone app would be fine.",

    "textPlain": "> and¬†what a pain in the ass it was to find the specific symbols I needed.But that's exactly the same issue with the hardware solution - you can't use Ctrl+F to find by name and you can't see all the many symbols on the keyboard itself. You'd need a software solution to show a visual searchable \"cheat sheet\", and also you can map more mathy keys to an existing bigger keyboard, where entering some symbols will be way more natural, e.g., for greeks you can map most of them to different A and B latin keys instead of having both Œ±Œ≤ on the same key. Similarly, you could do map ‚Ñ§ to Z and ‚Ñï to N, so these would be simpler to remember/input than using a dedicated keypad, so the printed symbols on the keypad aren't that useful anymore.",
