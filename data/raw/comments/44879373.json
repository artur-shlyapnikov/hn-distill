But interest rates went from 1% to 4.5% without valuations going down or profits going up. This means that investors are pricing companies as if though interests rates can be lowered. I don't think they can, because inflation in the US already quite high despite the 4.5% interest rates and with these tariffs upon that, it probably can't be lowered. For this reason I think companies should be priced using the 4.5% interest rate as a best guess, maybe 4% works, maybe 3.5%, but they're current priced as if though the interest rate is is <1%.Tesla has a P/E ratio something like 26 times what other well-run automotive companies have. Boeing has a price like Airbus, despite no profits, etc.Commercial real estate prices have gone down, and that's reasonable, but you've had both the interest rate increases and this WFH+hybrid remote thing becoming common, and since the interest rates have gone up from such a low level I think this is still overvalued, because 1% -> 2% should in theory mean halving the value if the rent is constant, and it went <1% to 4.5%.I think it's a miracle that there hasn't been a crash. I wonder what weird things have been going on that have ensured that there hasn't been one yet. So I think your perspective is strange.
