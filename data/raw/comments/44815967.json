It make cities nicer and America safer.Yes, these places are going to be drug infested slums. But it's still a good idea and I want my tax dollars to go towards it.And if we can add in some market-based options and give down-and-out humans the option of self-selecting to nicer facilities and working their way up to something better in life, all the better.",

They'd just crash in the rooms, all their meals and social events would be out in town or at their work place.I feel as though there would be a different tenant in the modern era. Some would be migrant young men trying to save every dime, but many would be those suffering mental illness, and they'd fill the unit with tons of stuff. Can you imagine how much more stuff Americans have these days than they did back in say 1900? I genuinely think that the volume of stuff/garbage would be a legitimate fire or structural hazard. No landlord would want that. Back in the old days landlords had a lot more ability to force out any tenants they didn't want.",

The \"homeless problem\", that is, the problem of mentally deranged or violent vagrants that make public spaces less usable or unwelcoming. This is difficult to impossible to measure, both in impact and in extent.2. The \"transient homeless\", that is, the down-on-their-luck or otherwise situationally homeless people. This is easy to measure because these people will attempt to secure housing and services to get back on their feet.Fixing #2, while worthwhile in itself, does nothing to fix #1. But well-intentioned people trying to fix \"homelessness\" find it much easier to address #2 because there are measurable outcomes, and no messy compromises to be made about civil liberties or individual freedom vs civil order. And this relies on the fact that since the same word is used, that it carries the same connotations. People hear \"reduce homelessness\" and they think that this means fewer people screaming about brainwaves and starting fights on the subway, but that's a completely separate issue.EDIT: removed discussion of SROs to another top level comment to avoid confusing discourse here",

It also favors incumbents who already own homes or received their parents' home.- Sprawl—zoning restrictions stifle the construction of high-density housing, which makes cities inaccessible, increases car dependence, negatively affects the environment, etc.",

You can't build anything like those due to rules about stairs, environmental laws about multiple family dwellings with internal stairs, and building codes that have such strict environmentally friendly rules that people cannot afford to live indoors.Up here in Seattle I was inquiring about extending my roof out to convert my cape code into a salt shaker style house, basically giving me two more bedrooms on the same lot. From an environmental perspective this is great, my house is over 70 years old, it is a sunk cost in terms of building material, and it was already updated with modern insulation years ago. I had an energy assessment done with I first moved in, and basically was told there isn't much I can do except fix the duct work but sadly no one does duct work anymore (I tried to find someone!)So anyway, my roof extension? The city would want me to replace my roof with larger wood so I could put in more insulation. An expensive undertaking that would have ZERO benefit to the house's energy profile. If they wanted me to paint the roof white, sure,  that'd make sense and help more than $30k extra of roof work.Another example is how the electrical code keeps getting more and more strict, such as having outlets every few feet in kitchens. That adds a lot to costs, with little to no benefit. If you add up all the incremental safety rules since the 90s, we're paying a ton for a very very small margin of improvement in safety.And none of these rules are making houses better! \"Home inspector discovers entire subdivision has leaking walls\" is an entire sub-genre of video on YouTube.So we're paying a lot small things we don't need (kitchens with a dozen outlets, AFCI breakers everywhere, 30k of lumber to save $5 a month on cooling) while the important things (walls that don't leak) are being ignored.",
