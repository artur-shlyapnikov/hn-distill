    "textPlain": "That's a neat thought!One could interpret the outcome of the game as a number by ○ being the digit 0 and ● being 1. For fun we could also say that if there is a repeating subsequence at the end (someone lost), then that is repeated infinitely. I suggest this because any won game has a sub-string repeated three times at the end, so we might as well repeat it to infinity!Say the example game, ● ● ○ ○ ● ● ○ ○ ● ● ○ ● ● ○ ● ○ ○ ● ● ○ ○ ● ● ○ ○ ●, would be 0.11001100110110100110011001, or perhaps 0.11001100110110(1001) where the parenthesis express infinite repetition. If we choose the first, it is 768160/959951 and the second would be 65553/81920.In any case, a won game would be a rational number, while a game which goes on forever would be an irrational! One could then wonder which irrational numbers are represented by such games.",

    "textPlain": "If it was a file filled entirely with one character, the compression could simply be to write a file saying \"this character copied 3 million times\", which is less than 512 bytes.This is not exactly what happens here, but many compression algorithms work by recognising that certain substrings are very common, and give them a \"shorter code\". In this game, there are some quite long such strings, giving a good compression rate. Furthermore, because of the recursive nature, it can find such patterns again after the common substrings are replaced by shorter codes, because these codes again form patterns with repeated substrings. This goes on until there is almost just a bit of meta data and an \"ur-pattern\".Compression is fascinating in many ways. For instance, since there are a fixed number of files of a certain size and some bigger files are made smaller, some smaller files must be made bigger by the compression! Of course, this could be as simple as attaching a header or flag which says \"I could not compress this. Here is the old file verbatim.\" But that is still a bit longer than the original!",
