(Never mind how long it actually took them to become big.)  Basically upper management incentivizes \"big bets\" that might turn into a \"moon shot\".  Those bets are new features.  You'll never get rich quick just by optimizing latency.  You might get rich slowly, but how is that going to pump the stock this quarter / get me promoted?",

I have been that engineer. But they are never in a position of power to overrule other parts of the company. This is especially true if it’s not a tech company.

    "textPlain": "It may seem absurd that the apps is costing Kroger that much but my family's experience backs it up.In the post-COVID era, my wife has become quite accustomed to digital shopping. We actually live closer to a Meijer, which is basically the Midwest's answer to Walmart, except it's decades older. (You may be able to thank Meijer for Super Walmarts; it's Meijer that proved out the concept of attaching a grocery store to a general superstore for Walmart, and it gave Walmart some difficulty penetrating in to the Midwest so they had to add it to compete.) Of course COVID caused a big app rush and at first everybody's app was pretty crappy, so we just stuck with the closest one.Over time, Meijer's app slowed down pretty badly, so my wife ended up switching to Kroger. I saw a lot of Kroger bags. One of the biggest problems was that trying to add a second of any item was a synchronous round-trip to a rather busy and slow server, so goodness help you if you wanted, say, 6 bananas. Going from 1 to 6 could literally take 30 seconds on the worst days. And that was just the worst issue, the whole app was generally slow and prone to failure.But somewhere around two years ago, clearly someone at Meijer got the performance religion and cleaned up their app and website. I still wouldn't call it blazing fast, but I would call it acceptable by modern standards, and it blew away the Kroger app of the time... again, not because it was pushing 120fps with super low latency, but just because it was fairly reasonable to use. Adding five more bananas is now just tapping the button five times, and while I can still kind of see the async requests chasing each other a bit, it pretty much always ends up converging on the correct number in a couple of seconds. So my wife switched back.I don't know what Kroger's current performance is, because now that we don't have a problem we haven't been seeking solutions. So they've lost thousands of dollars of business over the years to Meijer from us.An ane",

    "textPlain": "Maybe it's culture. Software is hard and the less unknowns you have in development the better. Frontend tools have exploded in complexity[1], but they get the job done. There are great alternatives nowadays, like phoenix liveview, but they would require full rewrites and possibly a change in language and software architecture that most teams just can't do, maybe because they are already heavily invested in whatever framework they are using or they can't afford to shift to elixir (or other languages, paradigms...).So they stay in this marshlands of bloated UI frameworks, and they need to push updates and new features which makes the problem worse.We seem to try to explain everything in software in technical terms, but sometimes at the end of the day culture and communication plays a larger role I think.
