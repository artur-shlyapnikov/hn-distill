    "textPlain": "EvenÂ in this article, it repeatedly refers to building out infrastructure in advance of an obviously approaching future need as \"oversupply\".This is almost a cliche in reporting on China that seems to reflect a serious blindpsot in western media and/or business attitudes.You can find plenty of articles complaining about \"overcapacity\" of battery factories in China even as they double in capacity and output each year.Chinese electricity generation went from 4,000 TWh (the same as the US) in 2010 to double that in 2020. The US was basically the same after 10 years.So a 100% \"oversupply\" in 2010 would be a zero percent oversupply within a decade given China's growth.Most telling to me is that decarbonisation and electrification of transport and heating has long been known to require a doubling(!) of electricity production for developed nations (and a similar increase in developing nations where it gets hidden by other growth).Apparently the US simply never had a plan to achieve that, and amazingly it still isn't part of the conversation around AI power. Instead they're just claiming the best parts of the existing power systems and passing the costs onto local consumers.",
