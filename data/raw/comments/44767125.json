Thicker laptops can have better cooling, bigger batteries, easier maintenance, a bloody ethernet port, and probably better keyboards.For some reason Lenovo has made the ThinkPad keyboard worse with every new generation. They're still better than other laptop keyboards, but my goodness the margin is shrinking.And while David Hill may claim that Lenovo TPs are as good as (or better than) IBM's, the number of repairs mine have had tell a different story. Since the x230, every single ThinkPad I've owned had to have its mainboard replaced. Sometimes even twice.",

I haven't had so many Thinkpads as others have had, but of the few i have owned, i think so far the T420 from i think circa 2011 (?) seemed to have the best balance of sturdy boxy goodness and wonderful keys and keyboard. While i would not say that i am a keyboard snob, i can certainly appreciate differences between the different types of keyboards like chiclets, or mechanical dedicated keyboards, etc. I'm sure beyond functional aspects, there is no doubt a nostalgia that i feel for these machines that is solely based on emotion...but who cares, since i always get more value than whatever i paid for them!On another aspect to this, it feels like Framework laptops has a chance to perhaps capture at least some of the positive sentiment that folks have/had for Thinkpads. I mean, sure, the swap-ability of the components is the most obvious comparison...but, i think Framework has also fostered a following by a community, that, if they play their cards right - and produce good, solid products - can turn into a successor to Thinkpads. I mean, obviously thinkpads are still here and all...but the folks at Framework have a big chance here, and i welcome the competition (since we all win as consumer if there is good, solid choices in the marketplace).  Let's hope both Thinkpads and Framework (and any other competitors) keep moving the needle forward to empower users with more options for good solid design, easy/self-repair, component swap-ability, sturdy/dependable hardware, and fair pricing!",

The lid latch was no longer needed as screens got lighter.

    "textPlain": "Sometimes, I travel with my nearly-15-year-old Thinkpad T420 in preference to my MacBook Air M1.The Macbook has a horrible keyboard with no travel. The buttonless trackpad is a pain to use; it's very hard to right-click and even with a 3rd party FOSS app to give me 3-finger middle-click, it's almost impossible to do it precisely. I use middle-click hundreds of times a day, but I have no use for trackpad gestures. It has a wretched 2 USB-C ports, one for power. I can't connect a mouse, keyboard, screen and power without carrying a dock. I can't upgrade the RAM. I recently had to remove Asahi Linux because it no longer had enough space to install the latest macOS 15 update -- the SSD can't be upgraded either.It feels like a laptop designed by and for a tablet user. I am not a tablet user. I don't like them much.The Thinkpad is a pleasure to use, and I can work on it all day for weeks without feeling especially cramped or anything. It has 2x the RAM and about 10x the SSD space. I've upgraded RAM, keyboard, main SSD, secondary SSD and battery, and it cost me next to nothing.The only virtues of the Macbook are that it's easy to carry and the battery lasts a long time. It's very unpleasant to actually work on.",
