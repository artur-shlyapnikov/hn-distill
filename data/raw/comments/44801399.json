    "textPlain": "Nice! You definitely have something there.I would love a dictionary lookup. I'd expect a big part of the strategy to be working backwards from the possible 1/2 letter words, but there's no way to tell how reasonable the dictionary is without testing, and getting the game into the proper state to test would be just as hard as solving the puzzle in the first place.Having two separate goals (eliminate all letters, find all the words) seems confusing. Honestly I find the latter to be a fairly tedious prospect, but the game really seems to push you toward it especially with the colors on the calendar depending on the % of words found. \"Damn it, I got a perfect score with no undos, and all I have to show for it is a red square showing how bad a job I did!\"The UI (on a desktop) felt kind of broken at the start because nothing has hover effects. Anything clickable would benefit from some kind of an effect, but especially the letters on the words. If you don't want color changes or animations, at least set the cursor style.",

    "textPlain": "A solver in SWI Prolog: https://swish.swi-prolog.org/p/PlayWhittle_Solver.pl which you can run by querying in the lower right window:    solve(\"brats herbs\", Steps).\n\nand seeing:    Steps = ['rats herbs', 'rat herbs', 'rat hers', 'rat her', rather, rater, rate, ate, at, a, ''] ;\n\nThe core is this grammar:    whittle(S0) --> [S1],                  % state S1 comes from\n                    { select(_, S0, S1),   % removing a char from S0,\n                      phrase(valid_state(_), S1) }, % S1 must be all words,\n                      whittle(S1).         % and recurse.\n    whittle([]) --> [].\n\nwhich describes a solution as a list of successful state changes from input to empty string. Each change removes one character from the string and must leave a valid state after doing that. Prolog's implicit backtracking search means that when it tries \"cat\",\"at\",\"t\" the valid_state check fails because \"t\" is not in the wordlist, it backtracks to the previous state \"cat\",\"at\" and retries, getting to \"cat,\"at\",\"a\",\"\" and success.So it's doing a depth-first search of the tree of all possible game states that come from removing each letter from each substring, only exploring each branch as deep as the first failure. It stops at the first success, but spacebar or 'next' will search for another solution. Find all 136 solutions by querying: findall(Steps, solve(\"brats herbs\", Steps), Solutions).It won't work in Scryer, it would need select/3 and the DCG helpers ported/included in the code, then changes to run on strings instead of character code lists. It would likely be more memory efficient then.",

In a similar word game [0] (also posted on HN recently; perhaps your inspiration?), the letters are in boxes that make them seem more like buttons you can press.  The unlabeled tabs at the bottom were also mysterious; many other games like Wordle have their inputs (e.g. a keyboard) at the bottom, so that was initially a bit confusing.It’s also easy to accidentally spoil the game by clicking the unlabeled right tab. EDIT: Oops, didn't realize that was the words discovered list, not the complete wordlist. This should have a label to make it clearer.Also, in the help screen, the dots in the UI made me expect to swipe (on mobile) to navigate between screens, so that was a bit confusing at first.0: https://www.shrinkle.org/",
