    "textPlain": "My dream productivity device is a modern take on a Psion 5MX.I don't mean I want a Psion 5MX with a bunch of hacks to keep it running - I've seen that, no thanks.I want the same great keyboard, same form factor, some ergonomics, but with a modern screen (mono/e-ink is fine), modern CPU, modern connectivity (wifi, bluetooth, usb-c, maybe 4G/5G eSIM if we're being fancy), and improved battery life with usb-c charging.The first thing that goes with all these geek PDAs and mini form-factors is the keyboard. I want to be able to type a short email, I want to be able to ssh into a server and use vim (so, yeah, ESC is needed or ability to remap caps lock or something), and also do some basic doc writing and perhaps a spreadsheet or two. A web browser would be nice.I don't need apps. I don't need a compressed desktop. I don't need games. It's a productivity device.Thinking about it as I type this, perhaps a psion-style keyboard for an iPhone might hit the spot if I figure out the right focus mode setup in iOS for when I need that mode. Maybe.I'm glad this hits the spot for some people... but that keyboard... no thanks.",

    "textPlain": "#1: This is fantastic from a conceptual perspective! Focus on simple computing tasks that are important, without distractions, ads etc. Open source, kit, looks well-designed.#2: I've programmed and used those EPD displays (The same model used here I believe specifically). They are neither a joy to program, or use. The programming is much more complicated than a normal display because of how you manage refreshes: Partial, full, when to do each etc. The latter because, as you can see in the video, the latency is high.I think responsivity and latency are one of the most important things for a pleasant user experience. We as engineers and developers have failed at this in general over the past ~2 decades. I think a device like this that breaks conventions is in a nice spot to also break this trend. Especially not using an OS (Or using an RTOS?), there should be no perceptible latency, if he changes to a normal display. I could tolerate a display like this for some uses and like a static sensor that runs on battery, but for an interactive device like this? No.",

    "textPlain": "Neat concept. It’d be interesting to do a spin on it that expands it to a 12”/13” footprint, allowing it to have a full keyboard, making it thinner (since components can be spread out), and making it more practical for tasks like writing. Think something like the defunct 12” MacBook, but with a minimal UI reminiscent of an 80s Mac on a grayscale display.There are e-ink tablets that can have a keyboard attached to them that kinda approximate that, but I’ve always found the KB-tablet-stand form factor clunky at best, and they tend to run some Android derivative which is going to feel slow compared to “bare metal” software running on an SBC.",
