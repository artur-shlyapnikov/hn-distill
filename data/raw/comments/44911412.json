    "textPlain": "The information in the article is shocking and disturbing, and largely known to most informed people.So I'm not sure what's meant by the \"got away with\" part.It's hard to call it \"getting away with\", when it's the standard operating procedure of the agency. What is it exactly that they don't get away with? With people being routinely killed worldwide.When I saw a little old lady, literally in a doily hat, in the BWI airport, looking terrified as she was forced to sit in the stainless steel seat, with her feet in the marked feet positions, as she was being questioned, because TSA had found a nail file in her bag 8-/ I knew the gangsters were out of the closet.Cornering, questioning, and roughing up the public, in public, was now fair game for the federal government.Dick Chaney's wet dream come true.All of this is now massively superseded by the cheeto administration. Masked people, in unmarked cars, dragging people off of the streets for shipment to foreign country's dark prisons.But the democratic administrations have also been eager user's of the \"Fascist State United Act\". Terrorism is functionally defined as anyone impeding the revenue stream of a large powerful organization.And once designated, there are many avenues of intimidation, up to and including murder. Which isn't usually needed, but is always available as an option.Recreating the Church commission today wouldn't be just difficult, it is completely impossible. The two dominant poitical parties have no interest in reform, and no one is going to stop them.",

    "textPlain": "Besides the Church Committee testimony, is there any evidence for the heart attack gun existing?  There's part of me that wonders if they made it up for the purpose of disclosing it to Congress, to make themselves seem like they were authentically participating in the overview and accountability proceedings.Kind of like the way murder suspects in police interrogations might give unprompted and quite possibly fake confessions to minor crimes, to manipulate the police into believing the suspect is being open about everything and doesn't have anything to hide.Part of my doubt stems from my confusion about how a traceless dart gun would actually work.  The dart guns I know of fire darts with fletchings, they can't be discrete.  If you removed the fletchings, the darts would almost certainly tumble.  If they said it was a BB gun that fired poisoned BBs then I wouldn't think twice about it, but they say it shot darts..",

And you weren't allowed to sue the vaccine manufacturer. And now Americans just sort of forgot about all that.This is because of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which provides compensation to people who are injured by vaccines in exactly the situation you're describing. I would encourage you to Google it.  You don't sue the vaccine manufacturer, you file a claim and get a payout.  RFK is trying to end this program, which would basically make it impossible to develop new vaccines.Americans did not \"forget\" about that, because most Americans have no clue this program even exists.They also lack the expertise to individually verify that a vaccine is safe, or even weight long-term potential health risks against the short term necessity of a vaccine.By the time the vaccines were approved for public use, they were also no longer \"experimental\" because the FDA HAD experimented with them and deemed them safe.",
