Each using different 'channels' from the harmony spec.I have a branch of llm-consortium where I was noodling with giving each member model a role. Only problem is it's expensive to evaluate these ideas so I put it on hold. But maybe now with oss models being cheap I can try and it on those.",

    "textPlain": "Yesterday I gave a presentation on the role of harmony in AI — as a matter of philosophical interest. I’d previously written a large literature review on the concept of harmony (here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240587262...). If you are curious about the slides, here: Bit.ly/ozora2025I assume they are using the concept of harmony to refer to the consistent response format? Or is it their intention for an open weights release?",

    "textPlain": "> The format enables the model to output to multiple different channels for chain of thought, and tool calling preambles along with regular responsesThat's pretty cool and seems like a logical next step to structure AI outputs. We started out with a stream of plaintext. In the future perhaps we'll have complex typed output.Humans also emit many channels of information simutaneously. Our speech, tone of voice, body language, our appearance - it all has an impact on how our information is received by another.",

Classic case of announcing something before the infrastructure is ready.This kind of coordination failure is surprisingly common with AI releases lately. Remember when everyone was trying to access GPT-4 on launch day? Or when Anthropic's Claude had those random outages during their big announcements?Makes you wonder if they're rushing to counter Google's Genie 3 news and got caught with their pants down during the GitHub outage. The timing seems too coincidental.At least when it does go live, having truly open weights models will be huge for the community. Just wish they'd test their deployment pipeline before hitting 'publish' on the blog post.",
