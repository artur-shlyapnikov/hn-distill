Such a challenge would not be prevented by the outcome of this claim.Basically, DENIED, DENIED, DENIED.

Presumably because they are now parents of children newly reaching this age.They are completely ignoring that they are entering a debate that's been going on for longer than they have been alive, and are just arguing from a source of \"common sense\" gut feelings. They are literally a third of a century behind on this issue, but it doesn't stop them talking about it.They are incompetent on this issue (nothing bad about that. I'm incompetent in most things), but they are also stupid because they don't let that incompetence stop them.They are too incompetent to understand that they just did the equivalent of entering a room full of mathematicians with a collective thousands of years of math knowledge, and saying \"how about just making 2+2=5? You could make 2+2=4, so you smart people should be able to do it\". How do you even start with someone this ignorant?
