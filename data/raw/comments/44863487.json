In doing so, he would have to act compatibly with the Convention. Any failure to do so could also be subject to further challenge. Such a challenge would not be prevented by the outcome of this claim.Basically, DENIED, DENIED, DENIED. Ofcom can keep the loaded gun pointed in Wikipedia's face, forever, and make as many threats as it likes. Only if it pulls the trigger does Wikipedia have a case.Wikipedia should voluntarily remove itself from the UK entirely. No visitors, no editors.",

But the Wikimedia foundation haven't presented an argument as to why the regulations are unlawful, just an argument for why they disagree with them.Ofcom's SI could simply be modified to exclude research texts, and it could even be modified to exclude Wikipedia specifically; there's no obvious problem with that considering its scale and importance.If you go through Ofcom's checker:https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-c...The answers are 1) yes, 2) yes, 3) no, 4) probably \"No, but...\", 5) no, 6) no.But the answer to getting out of the problem entirely might be to change the answer to question 6 -- that is, register Wikipedia as an education provider in the UK (since it is already used in that capacity).I mean Wikipedia have actually exhibited at BETT, the main educational tech show here; Jimmy Wales did a keynote.",
