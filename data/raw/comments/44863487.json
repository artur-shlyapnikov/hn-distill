That will get the attention of media and popularity contest politicians might change their mind.Remember the \"Repeal the Online Safety Act\" petition? It has gotten over half a million signatures and the response from the government was a loud \"no\".> The Government has no plans to repeal the Online Safety Act, and is working closely with Ofcom to implement the Act as quickly and effectively as possible to enable UK users to benefit from its protections.https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/722903",

    "textPlain": "> If Ofcom permissibly determines that Wikipedia is a Category 1 service, and if the practical effect of that is that Wikipedia cannot continue to operate, the Secretary of State may be obliged to consider whether to amend the regulations or to exempt categories of service from the Act. In doing so, he would have to act compatibly with the Convention. Any failure to do so could also be subject to further challenge. Such a challenge would not be prevented by the outcome of this claim.Basically, DENIED, DENIED, DENIED. Ofcom can keep the loaded gun pointed in Wikipedia's face, forever, and make as many threats as it likes. Only if it pulls the trigger does Wikipedia have a case.Wikipedia should voluntarily remove itself from the UK entirely. No visitors, no editors.",

But the Wikimedia foundation haven't presented an argument as to why the regulations are unlawful, just an argument for why they disagree with them.Ofcom's SI could simply be modified to exclude research texts, and it could even be modified to exclude Wikipedia specifically; there's no obvious problem with that considering its scale and importance.If you go through Ofcom's checker:https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-c...The answers are 1) yes, 2) yes, 3) no, 4) probably \"No, but...\", 5) no, 6) no.But the answer to getting out of the problem entirely might be to change the answer to question 6 -- that is, register Wikipedia as an education provider in the UK (since it is already used in that capacity).I mean Wikipedia have actually exhibited at BETT, the main educational tech show here; Jimmy Wales did a keynote.",

They wait until someone brings an actual case.Ofcom haven't ruled Wikipedia is Category 1. They haven't announced the intention to rule it Category 1. The Category 1 rules are not yet in effect and aren't even finalised.Wikipedia have a case that they shouldn't be Category 1 if that happens. But they went fishing in advance.I don't really understand why people don't get this.First, it's a statutory instrument that ministers will amend if it has unintended, severe consequences.Second, the rules in question have not been written yet and they are being written in conjunction with industry (which will include Wikipedia).",
