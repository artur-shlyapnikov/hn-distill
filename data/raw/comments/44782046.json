    "textPlain": "Well, you can definitely sense it if you browse Reddit. Young people are freaking out about the job market, the house market, and the dating market. I don't mean to dismiss their concerns, far from it. It does seem like we've been making it harder and harder for anyone to become an adult over the past few decades.Here's the quote I found most relevant to my own experience of work. It really does come down to autonomy. I could be writing the exact same code and feel awful about it, if it were done in an office with a guy looking over my shoulder. If you're young, you're more likely to have this problem.> More broadly, employers are successfully deploying new technologies to minimize ‘break’ times,\nand exert greater control over production processes, often aided by close technological monitoring\nof work processes, which limit worker control and autonomy over ever-more-demanding\nprocesses, all of which – based on Karasek’s (1979) theory regarding the importance of worker\ncontrol and autonomy for wellbeing – should result in a decline in the wellbeing of workers.\nEvidence from task-based studies of work, and social surveys in which workers report on the nature\nof job tasks, indicates there has been a growth in job demands and a reduction in worker job control\nin the United Kingdom (Green et al., 2022) which, presumably, is mirrored in the United States.\nDuring COVID, the shift to home and hybrid working, whilst beneficial in some respects, may\nhave exacerbated feelings of social isolation experienced by the young in particular as they missed\nout on the social component of the workplace. The demise of collective bargaining and trade union\npresence in the workplace implies a diminution in workers’ bargaining power, making it even more\ndifficult for workers to resist such changes and to alter their terms and conditions of employment\n(Feiveson, 2023).",

When foreigners are puzzled and ask me why is X or Y happening in America, this is usually the best answer. The majority of young people, but not the majority of the electorate, are in a tough or even dire situation, and so they do not have much interest in maintaining the status quo. The result is social upheaval, the varieties of which I'm sure we're all familiar with by now, and need not be repeated.",

    "textPlain": "As the parent of two mid-20's adults (one thriving, the other not so much) I actually downloaded the paper and read it out of curiosity (shocking, I know.)They asked people how many days last month they had \"bad mental health days\" (\"Q1\".) The measure of Despair in the graphs is constructed as: \"by setting the Q1 variable to one when an individual gave the answer 30 and zero otherwise.\" So if you had a continuous month of \"bad mental health days\" you are in despair. The fraction of those months is y-axis in the graphs (typically around 0-10%)This is all US data BTW.Anyway, the abstract and title oversimplify the data in my opinion. Across the board (even up to 60+ years of age) the surveyed report overall 2x more \"despair\" than in the 1990's. Yes, it is worse amongst under 40 workers, as shown in Figure 4. Despair used to be pretty flat by age for workers, now it it highest for young workers, with linear-ish decrease until about 60 where the value hasn't really changed over time.But the graph in Figure 8 shows that \"despair\" hasn't really moved much for any age group of college educated workers since the 1990's. And their mention of the change in the \"hump\" shaped in the abstract doesn't account for the fact that in absolute terms, unsurprisingly, the unemployed have a lot more despair overall than workers.So the \"young workers\" in the title are those without a college education in the US - that's probably a very different demographic than the average HN participant...",

I want to see tech that loves inviting people under the hood if they want, that's designed for plugins & the user's existing LLM/agents to come drive machine-toachone style.I don't necessarily know how that would help economically, but spiritually I think it would be lifting to have a different socio-techncial contract; I think tech could offer some dignity & open doors in a way that escapes the plight of rank consumerism that's eating humanity's collective soul away.It's really so so sad thinking that the US is so quickly developing such a similar \"lie flat\" hopelessness.

Real wages have alsobeen on the rise. As Feiveson (2024) has noted the relative prices of housing and childcare haverisen. Student debt is high and expensive. The health of young adults has also deteriorated, asseen in increases in social isolation and obesity. Suicide rates of the young are rising. Moreover,Jean Twenge provides evidence that the work ethic itself among the young has plummeted. Somehave even suggested the young are unhappy having BS jobs.There is a good deal of supporting evidence from a variety of surveys including from Pew, theConference Board and Johns Hopkins on the parlous state of young worker well-being in the USAthat we documented here. The concern is that we are observing the consequences of past well-being shocks. We should note that 10.1% of workers aged 20 in 2023 said they were in despair.They were aged 17 when COVID lockdowns were implemented in 2020. They were 10 years oldin 2013 as the smartphone and the internet exploded. In addition, of course, they were in highschool ages 14-18 in 2017-2021. We know from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey that the well-being of high school students deteriorated sharply around that time.15Jean Twenge suggested to us that an explanation for this, maybe that childhood and teenage yearswith low levels of in-person interaction and more time online, such as have occurred since 2014or so, results in depression and pessimism and dissatisfaction across many domains (includingwork). Social media glamorizes others' lives plus online news and social media encouragepessimism about jobs and the economy in general. This lik",
