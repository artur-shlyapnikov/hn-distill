I've worked on Gecko for 10+ years, and we were constantly called names for absolutely any change we would do. Insulted and accused of the worst intentions.I see it hasn't changed.",

    "textPlain": "The problem with browsers is that they rely on other standards. If a browser needs to maintain backward compatibility and requires an evolving standard that ALSO requires backward compatibility, this acts like a multiplier on implementation complexity. This also means it becomes increasingly difficult to spin up a new browser engine, and the fewer of those there are, the easier it is for the big ones to just add what they want and have it become a standard, reinforcing the issue.",

I haven’t personally used it in 25 years. The complexity and attack surface area isn’t justified by its utility, so it’s hard to make the case for keeping it.",
