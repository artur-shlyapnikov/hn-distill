    "textPlain": "We’ve been working on this problem off and on for over a year now. Many models bake knowledge of particular tools/libraries/patterns into their weights very well and others quite poorly. In my experience Claude is quite good at integrating the dog.ceo API and noticeably ignorant when it comes to Postgres features, and it knows gcloud commands enough to very confidently and consistently hallucinate arguments.We’ve baked a solution to this into our product, so if anybody is working on an API/SDK/etc feel free to contact me if your users are running into problems using LLMs to integrate them.One thing we’ve noticed is that subtle changes to library/api integration prompts’ context can be surprisingly impactful. LLMs do very well with example commands and explicit instructions to consider X, Y, and Z. If you just dump an API reference and information that implicitly suggests that X, Y, and Z might be beneficial, they won’t reliably make the logical leaps you want them to unless you let them iterate or “think” (spend more tokens) more. But you can’t as easily provide an example for everything, and the ones you do will bias the models towards them, so you may need a bit of both.",

The latest version of the Phoenix Framework (1.8) includes it in their `mix phx.new` generator and in their own hex packages[1]. Library owners would need to add their own usage rules, but it seems to help even for just the core packages Phoenix includes.[0] https://hexdocs.pm/usage_rules/readme.html[1] https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/tree/main/usage-...",

Almost none focus on library-specific generation.So we built a simple app to test how well coding agents interact with libraries:\n • Takes your library’s docs\n • Automatically extracts usage examples\n • Tasks AI agents (like Claude Code) with generating those examples from scratch\n • Logs mistakes and analyzes performanceWe’re testing libraries now, but it’s early days. If you're interested: Input your library, see what breaks, spot patterns, and share the results below.We plan to expand to more coding agents, more library-specific tasks, and new metrics. Let us know what we should prioritize next.",
