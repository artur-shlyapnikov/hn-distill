So someone told me to use pipenv, which was great until it was abandoned and picked up by someone who routinely broke the latest published version. So someone told me to use poetry, but it became unusably slow. So I switched back to pip with the built-in venv, but now I have the and problems I had before, with fewer features. So I switched to uv, because it actually worked. But the dependency I need is built and packaged differently for different operating systems and flavor of GPU, and now my coworkers can't get the project to install on their laptops.I'm so glad all the Python packaging challenges are \"solved\"",
