    "textPlain": "I have two elementary school age boys, and one day I complained about someone who was vaping and they solemnly informed me that vaping was more deadly than smoking. This is what they had learned in school; the anti-vaping hype was so aggressive that it had gone to the point and then right past it.If you're going to use a nicotine product, please vape. Also don't vape. But smoking is so much worse that they're not in the same league.",
