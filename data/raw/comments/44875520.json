    "textPlain": "> Ethan Guo was hoping to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continentsI think a more favorable title is \"US pilot stranded in Antarctica after landing plane without permission\". They chose the word \"influencer\" for a reason, even though it was a pilot trying to set a record that happened to film himself. He's even flying to raise funds for cancer research.Too bad he lied to ground control, what a great way to lose your license, prison aside.",

    "textPlain": "\"Stranded\" implies he is physically stuck, but the article contradicts itself on several points.> \"I remain in Antarctica awaiting approval for my departure flight\"> He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory> He must also leave the country as soon as conditions allow> Guo’s plane “does not have the capabilities to make a flight”As a reader, it's hard to understand exactly what is happening. This is very poor reporting.The most interesting detail in buried in the last paragraph:> The prosecutor’s office said Guo must also pay all costs for his “aircraft security and personal maintenance” during his stay at the military facility. He also needs to cover all expenses for his return.So the real reason he is \"stranded\" is extortion.",
