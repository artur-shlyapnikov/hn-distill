    "textPlain": "I worked in health care tech for about 5 years. AI driven before it was cool. Took processes that normally took years down to a couple hours. Cutting edge stuff.What struck me over the years was the open hostility we faced from the staff. The admins would buy our product, then have us come do trainings. The clinicians seemed to resent every second of it and would just never use the tool.Towards the end of my tenure there, a PM said to me “the last thing these people want is to have to learn yet another workflow”. Which is when the penny dropped for me that our tool was just one of a bazillion being force fed to these poor people. They want to spend their time with patients not a screen.Despite it being the most mission driven I have ever felt about a product (we were literally trying to help cure cancer lol). I’ll never work in health care again. Like education, it’s a quagmire.",

    "textPlain": "It’s true that many providers need a custom solution for their unique workflows, and the one-size-fits-all EHR is often a myth. The problem is that many EHRs try to solve this with customizations, which can be expensive and still feel like a compromise.On the other hand, when a team tries to build their own tools, they quickly realize they have to build a ton of compliance and interop code they never wanted to touch in the first place. That’s why open source platforms that handle the core infrastructure, like Medplum, HAPI, or OpenEMR, can be such a good starting point. They get the team 90% of the way there, so they can focus on what really matters: building a great UI/UX for their users.I don’t think providers truly want to go back to pen and paper, but they are looking for a better way. They can see the promise of what the solution could be, but they just haven't experienced it yet.Disclaimer: I work for Medplum.",

    "textPlain": "I would assume the most important feature for doctors for any device UI is that things don't always change. The entire medical field selects for people with great memory, and so even if it is a bit complex at first, as long as they only have to figure it out once they aren't going to easily forget. Even if some other design is more sleek and intuitive for a first time user, the change is only going to mess up the 95% of the established personnel. Any potential tool changes need to provide significant improvements over the old stuff and need to be done sparingly.To doctors these things are just tools, tools that they want to be able to pick up and put down 100 times a day without having to think about it. A good tool can be operated mostly on muscle memory and needs to remain static 99% of the time. Imagine if the tools a mechanic or carpenter used changed in form and function all the time. Last year they used a right handed circular saw, next year they are forced to use a left handed worm saw. Or imagine a framer picking up his hammer he has used for the last 10+ years and going to give it a swing and missing his mark, only to find out last night his boss took his old hammer and replaced it with one 2 ounces lighter and 2 inches longer and his boss refused to give his old one back. Or a guy digging through his toolbox to pull out a lesser used item like helicoils that he knows is in a medium sized yellow box, wasting tons of time looking and possibly going for a different and less ideal solution, only to find out later the helicoils were at some point put placed into a small sized blue box instead because someone else decided the old box was a bit too big and wasting space.",

It's probably not as bad as that, there probably is some record-keeping happening in there.

To make things worse, one system is made in Flash and all computers need to have an outdated Chrome version with the Flash plugin to run it. The other system is made in Java and some form of custom frontend framework, which works ok until it doesn't.Expanding on this other system made in Java, it's a federal hospital, and we have other internal systems which doesn't communicate with this main EHR, so for example emitting radiology requests need us to copy paste information from two systems (like address, contact numbers), and on top of that those systems aren't connected to the national patient registry, and daily I have residents redoing requests to merge the information, otherwise the requests are made invalid.I haven't touched on payments, imagine that each health insurance plan have different billings and we need to adapt the reality of what we did to what code better pays and input that in the system, so in practice the records are tailor fitted for each payment system, the actual procedure descriptions change, and we need to remember all that when billing and when treating the patient.Add on top of that system outage and unreliability, and I haven't even touched much on the UI, which sometimes loses input text data or sometimes we have to input in certain fields order or",
