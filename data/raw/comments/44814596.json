    "textPlain": "Always fun to see Multics pop up; the influence it had on computing is pretty impressive and its influence lives on in many projects. As just one personally relevant example, the SCOMP mentioned in the glossary [0] and described in more detail on the history page under 5.4.1 [1] became the STOP operating system which is still in active development and is what I still work on today. (Technically, the SCOMP was the whole machine, and STOP \"SCOMP Trusted Operating Program\" was its operating system). Up until pretty recently, we still had a Multician working on STOP, and have a guy from the Honewell days still plugging away on it.[0]https://www.multicians.org/mgs.html#SCOMP\n[1]https://www.multicians.org/history.html",

    "textPlain": "We used Multics when I was at Bristol Uni in the UK c.1980. I can only remember two things about it:1) The system was initially deemed slow, so they installed an extra 256 KB of RAM (for a system serving dozens/hundreds of students - Bristol was regional computing center), and that made a difference! This was a big deal - apparently quite expensive!2) Notwithstanding 1), it was fast, and typical student FORTRAN assignments of a 100 or so lines of code would compile and link essentially instantly - hit enter and get prompt back. I wish compilers were this fast today on 2025's massively faster hardware!",

    "textPlain": "My Operating Systems class as an undergrad used a book written by the Multics guys.I hated it. It would present a bunch of apparently incompatible techniques for e.g. job scheduling, and then say that Multics implemented all of them. I immediately understood why UNIX came about: the Multics designers appeared incapable of having opinions, which led to an OS that was bloated and hard to understand.That class was a long time ago, and I was a young, arrogant, and uninformed programmer, and maybe that take was wrong. But it left a strong impression at the time, and it was one of the few books from my undergrad days that I sold back instead of keeping.",
