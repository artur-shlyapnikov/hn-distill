    "textPlain": "I recently discovered a static site generator called Astro, which supports many syntaxes but the .astro is a nice mix of TypeScript and JSX-like syntax. Content can use MDX which is like Markdown but with {JSX} style markup for variables and etc. The static components are used very similar to React, with familiar import statements and <ComponentName props=etc> patterns. It is extremely easy to pick up. Best of all, it has plugins to support all sorts of other interactivity, so you can create interactive 'islands' of content using React or Preact or SolidJS or Vue etc. That way you have most of your content statically generated, and then the dynamic parts can be done from the client side.Best of all, if you use simple unchanged files for other dynamic stuff like JSON etc, you can just generate those on build and serve those files in the host directly as the 'response' to a simple REST request, which is sometimes overlooked despite being the most fundamental form of a REST API.https://astro.build/I came across this after researching various options for a website that had, mostly for my own entertainment, restrictions on wanting to be mostly statically generated but customizable easily without learning a lot of new syntax / etc, something JSX-like with Markdown support etc, and MDX was an immediate find - and astro was the easiest SSG I found for it after trying with 11ty and several others. Actually felt like a delight playing with it.",

Originally I had my own hacky way of using HTML which was effectively to (1) replace all HTML with placeholder_number (2) format the markdown (3) replace placeholder_number with the html that used to be there. Not as simple as that but close.Eventually i switched to a commonmark spec formatter and then tried to fix any old pages that had spaces in the HTML. Some were basically hard to fix like a pre section with code inside so I added some other hacks to do the same as above for those sections by surrounding them with {{#html}}....stuff..with...blank...lines{{/html}}.So now my solution is handlebars.js meets markdown-it.",

I ended up making a tiny python build script to process fake html components into proper HTML: https://github.com/shminge/builderI've designed it for myself, deliberately to work around the flaws with web components mentioned. It hugely speeds up my process of writing pages for my blog (after trying everything, I've ended up just writing plain html) because I can define a component that holds all the boilerplate of the page (header, css, etc) and then write my pages as `<pagelayout> <p> body content here </p> </pagelayout>` and have that be expanded into proper valid HTML",

    "textPlain": ">In the end, your document is now fully an HTML document, not a Markdown document that becomes an HTML document. It’s a minor perspective shift, but might have some cascading effects on things I’ve written above.But this style of custom-elements requires successful javascript program execution to achieve that \"HTML\" document. Just like markdown requires some parser program to turn it in to HTML. It's not really fully an HTML document.It's a good idea. It just would be a better one to write the custom-elements as wrappers for actual HTML elements. Like how https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components-an-exa... shows instead of trying to do it SPA style and requiring perfect JS execution for anything to show properly.HTML mark-up really isn't that heavy. The avoidance of it seems mostly to be because it's considered \"old\" and \"old\" is bad, or at least not useful on a resume. But it's old because it's so good it's stuck around for a long time. Only machine generated HTML is bulky. Hand written can be just as neat and readable as any Markdown.",

It was great.Apart from that, also back in the day people were still building pages using e.g. Dreamweaver, so we also put together a thing that could leverage a designer's HTML that rendered as a complete placeholder page. That \"works as plain .HTML\" became the template, used YAML as data, and Enlive (a Clojure lib) to turn the HTML with its placeholders into a template and then stuff YAML sidecar data into it to generate new HTML.Not long after, Caddy's markdown support had promise, but agree with another commenter here that a few years ago astro.build started hitting a more interesting spot.  In the middle ages between those, yay pandoc.",
