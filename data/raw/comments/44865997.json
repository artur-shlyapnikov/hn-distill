    "textPlain": ">In the end, your document is now fully an HTML document, not a Markdown document that becomes an HTML document. It’s a minor perspective shift, but might have some cascading effects on things I’ve written above.But this style of custom-elements requires successful javascript program execution to achieve that \"HTML\" document. Just like markdown requires some parser/etc to turn it in to HTML. It's not really fully an HTML document.It's a good idea. It just would be a better one to write the custom-elements as wrappers for actual HTML elements. Like how https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components-an-exa... shows instead of trying to do it SPA style and requiring perfect JS execution for anything to show properly.HTML mark-up really isn't that heavy. The avoidance of it seems mostly to be because it's considered \"old\" and \"old\" is bad, or at least not useful on a resume. But it's old because it's so good it's stuck around for a long time. Only machine generated HTML is bulky. Hand written can be just as neat and readable as any Markdown. And when it's all actual HTML everything in the workflow stays very, very simple.",
