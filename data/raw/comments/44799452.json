    "textPlain": "A cool fact about the 4004 is that the Busicom calculator project it was used in actually used the 4004 to interpret a more capable virtual machine, in whose machine code the calculator app was actually written. Intel did not quite build a general-purpose processor in whose instruction set the application was written directly.",

The gate level simulation is of a different device that emulates a 4004.To be fair, the whole program is amazing as a logic simulator implementation, I'm just nitpicking.",

    "textPlain": "I hate to be this critical, but this is not emulating the actual 4004.It's a logic circuit simulator that takes in a compressed representation of something and runs it, with an I/O mechanism that emulates the Busicom calculator hardware (keyboard and printer).Still impressive for the size of the code, but the \"CPU\" is nothing like a 4004, or any real microprocessor.",
