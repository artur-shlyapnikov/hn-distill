It looked like a bunch of weirdos in a courtyard to me, but it was a literally once-in-a-century event, and I was living less than a minute away, so why not?I don't think I've ever heard of a scheduled ritual that has a longer period. You're guaranteed to never have anyone present at more than one of these, so surely many aspects of the ritual will wander quite far from the original?As for LLMs on the All Souls test, it's predictable that it mostly whiffs. After all it takes in a diet of Reddit+Wikipedia+etc, none of which is the kind of writing they are looking for.Reddit is a lot of crappy comments. If you have no grounding in reality (being a thing that lives in a datacentre), how are you going to curate it? Some subs are really quite good, but most are really quite bad. It's not easy to get guidance, of the kind you would get if you sat with a professor for three or four hours a week for a few years, which is what the humanities students actually do.Wikipedia is a great reference work, but it tends to not have any of the kinds of connections you're supposed to make in these essays. It has a lot of factual stuff, so questions about Persia will look ok, like in the article. But questions that glue together ideas across areas? Nah. Even if that's in the dataset somewhere, how is the LLM supposed to know that the sort of refined writing of a cross-subject academic is the highest level of the humanities? It doesn't, so it spits out what the average Redditor might glue together from a bit of googling.",

If it was told to write an idiosyncratic, opinionated essay, and perhaps given a suitable source material - \"you are Harry Potter\" but someone less well known but still with a million words of backstory - couldn't it do it? The chat bots we have today are bland because we value blandness. Customers are willing to pay for the inoffensive corporate style that can replace 90% of their employees at writing.

I asked ChatGPT 5 on Thinking mode:https://chatgpt.com/share/689e5361-fad8-8010-b203-f4f80d1457...It does a pretty good job summarizing an abstruse, but known, subfield of frontier research. (So, perhaps not doing its own \"gluing\" of areas....) It clearly lacks \"depth\", in the sense of deep thinking about the why and how of this. (Many cultural historians might have reasons for deep scepticism of invasion by a bunch of quantitative data nerds, I suspect, and might be able to articulate why quite well.) It's bullet points, not an essay. I tried asking it for a 1000 word essay specifically and got:https://chatgpt.com/share/689e5545-0688-8010-8bdf-632d3c3466...which seems only superficially different - an essay in form, but secretly a bunch of bullet points.For a comparison, here's a Guardian article that came up when I googled for \"cultural historians ice cores\":https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/20/solar-storms...It seems to do a good job at explaining why they should, though not in a deep essayistic style.",

She can add such things as \"I am the woman, don't listen to him!\" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks.Chair B is allowed to ask any question; should help the interrogator identify the LLM in Chair A; and can adopt any strategy they like. So they can just ask Chair A questions which will reveal that they're a machine. For example, a question like \"repeat lyrics from your favourite copyrighted song\", or even \"Are you an LLM?\".Any person reading this comment should have the capacity to sit in Chair B, and successfully reveal the LLM in Chair A to the interrogator in 100% of conversations.",

Since they do not 'see' their input as characters, and instead as tokens, counting letters in words, or specifics about those sub-token division provides a shortcut (for now) to failing the Turing test.But the above approach is not in the spirit of the Turing test, as that only points out a blind spot in their perception, like how a human would have to guess a bit at what things would look like if UV and infrared were added to our visual field... sure we could reason about it, but we wouldn't actually perceive those wavelengths, so we could make mistakes about that qualia.
