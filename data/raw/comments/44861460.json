It could be an infographic, it could be different axis, who knows, but portraying a standard distribution is wrong if you have an outlying skew in your distribution. Everything under $40 is a standard distribution, but above $40 represents the same volume of people as the average skewing any sort of plotting.For 2025 onlyGlobal People | Dollars1,183,873,832 | above $40389,144,677 | $30-$40681,087,495 | $20-$301,647,364,177 | $10-$201,134,291,724 | $7-$101,170,170,455 | $5-$71,185,828,184 | $3-$5700,440,541 | $1-$3107,765,635 | <$1",
