    "textPlain": "I had long term business relationship with a company, originating and developing a product for them.From 50 - 1000 employees things worked very well. There was a great deal of continuity in the relationship. Lots of trust and flexibility in both directions. Our product quickly became the best available, by a long margin, and for a couple decades.But after they passed about 1500 - 2000 employees they got more organized. A formalized organization and process system. Things quickly went downhill. As someone working from outside the company, their processes were incredibly disruptive and inefficient for me. Likewise, their turnover replaced a situation of working with long time friendly colleagues, who knew me very well, to working with people who had no idea what my positive reputation was, my track record of delivering quality without the hammer of conformance, etc.The project's ambitious upward trajectory stalled. Even then it took about ten years to fall behind other players. But it never recovered. Today it operates deep in the shadows of others.Virtually every employee I worked with was wonderful, inclined to be as supportive as restrictions allowed, etc. But the institutionalization smothered the organizations ability to operate with any flexibility, no matter how dysfunctional or value destroying the results.The company became like someone who has permanently lost the ability to form new memories.You can't build anything special with someone who keeps forgetting any context. I spent many years cycling between depression and resurrected determination trying. But finally gave up.",

    "textPlain": "There is a (possibly apocryphal) story of cars being specified to understand a 100kmh air speed on the rear windscreen. 'Ridiculous, it can't reverse at more than 30kmh said the car designers' and ignored the spec. The first time new cars were transported on a train, all the rear windscreens blew in.A long time ago I worked on a software product to try to record design decisions in the creation of long-lived artefacts, such as nuclear reactors. The idea being that engineers looking to make a change 20+ years later (when the original engineers had retired) would understand why something had been designed the way it had.The project was not a success, despite some initial enthusiasm from some commercial sponsors. I think this was due to 2 main issues:a) The software infrastructure of the days wasn't really up to it. This was just before wikis, intranets etc, which would have made everything a lot easier.b) The engineers working on the design had no incentive to record the rationale of their decisions. It was extra work with no benefit for them (any benefit was by someone else, years down the line). In fact it could make it more likely for them to be held liable for a bad decision. And, in an age of cheap outsourcing, it could reduce their job security.The second problem was by far the more important and I don't know how you get around it.",

    "textPlain": "A few thoughts:1. Institutional memory does seem important. It feels like lots of government things are bad at this – big infrastructure projects tend to come in occasional bursts which means each time they are learning from scratch; Japan moves lots of civil servants around every few years which means that no one really remembers how to do things.2. I think there is a negative side of this too, a kind of ‘institutional trauma’ where some bad memory can cripple an institution. Eg one reason Microsoft lost so much to Google in the early Internet was the memory of the late ’90s antitrust action making them less aggressive. Other companies can have one particular close shave which then causes them to focus too much on avoiding a repeat, a situation you also see writ small in tech teams.3. I think a bit about production incidents in tech too here. When things are small and the systems are relatively new and they break a lot, this may be ok for the business and recovery can hopefully be fast because it is possible to quickly hypothesise / fix stupid problems. When most silly bugs have been squashed and systems are big and reliable, problems can snowball faster, the business may be more sad about them happening, people can’t understand the whole picture well enough to have good ideas, and the lower base rate of incidents means people will be more stressed or otherwise unable to focus on the actual problem",

    "textPlain": "This is one of the biggest consequences of layoffs in corporations.  There's this misconception that everything can and is \"objectively\" quantified, and thus layoffs targeting otherwise well-performing individuals are being done because this will quantifiably save the institution money and resources.  Then something inevitably happens where someone they previously let go could've saved the cost of their employment and then some in damages, but the company is often too blind to realize this.Thing is, I've seen this time and time again.  A lot of us have, I suspect, seen this story repeatedly in our own current or prior organizations.  Someone who worked for the company for a decade, or who had intricate knowledge of prior M&As, technology stacks, codebases, customers, and/or processes who was thrown out as a line on a spreadsheet.I do my best to buck the trend in my work by documenting everything (the \"bus problem\", as I call it) I can and sharing it with my colleagues, but the continuous churn of M&As and software deprecation means that documentation is often discarded with old systems rather than reviewed and preserved, thus further erasing any lingering institutional memory.To be fair, this issue isn't likely to kill a company outright on its own. Sure, it could lead to a serious problem and cost gobs of money, but it rarely kills a company or project outright in the process.  Still, it's preventable harm just by keeping some additional persons around for knowledge or managing an organizational library of content.  It's ultimately such a minor cost in the grand scheme of things that shareholders won't really care.  $1m a year for a corporate library and a handful of staff to support it is peanuts on a multi-billion dollar enterprise balance sheet, and will almost certainly improve outcomes across the organization as a whole.Or to put it far more simply: institutional memory is the fat on an animal.  Cutting fat down to the bone leaves the animal weaker and vulnera",

The length of time that it takes to develop things like this, combined with the turnover and the sheer amount of context that single developer has to have to be successful with it, is one of the driving forces in why development is such a difficult/risky business.It's one of the most consequential problems imaginable to solve, particularly as the US begins to realize that we need to compete with decades of China's subsidized energy and industrialization/manufacturing capacity.Taking it a level deeper, what most don't realize is that infrastructure is an asset class: before someone funds the construction of $100M of solar technology, a developer will spend 2-5 years developing 15 or so major commercial agreements that enable a lender/financier to take comfort that when they deploy such a large amount of cash, they'll achieve a target yield over 20+ years. Orchestrating these negotiations (with multiple \"adversaries\") into a single, successfully bankable project is remarkably difficult and compared to the talent needed, very few have the slightest clue how to do this successfully.Our bet at Phosphor is that this is actually solvable by combining natural language interfaces with really sophisticated version control and programming languages that read like english for financial models and legal agreements, which enables program verification. This is a really hard technical challenge because version control like Git really doesn't work: you need to be able to synchronize multiple lenses of change sets where each lens/branch is a dynamic document that gets negotiated. Dynamically composable change sets all the way down.We are definitely solving this at Phosphor (phosphor.co) and we're actively hiring for whoever is interested in working at the intersection of HCI, program verification, natural language interfaces and distributed ",

I worked for a well run large government bureaucracy that was both confounding and frustrating and great at execution.The organization executed the mission very well. They had solid process and controls. They knew why they had the controls. People were really smart and motivated.The confounding part was that any change was impossible because there was an expectation of that level of rigor for new things. Literally took a year to approve using Google.",

Whether that inconveniences anyone for any length of time depends mostly on how full the reservoirs at the top end of the canal are...Wouldn't have been that unusual in 1972 when nearly all the canals including that one had ceased commercial operations and many of them had been intentionally drained either. I suspect the transition from the canal being infrastructure maintained by locally-stationed full time professionals to a pleasure cruiseway which the new waterways board was willing to devote a bit of time to maintaining only after the previous one had spent several years trying to get it shut down probably had as much impact as the Blitz on the work crew having no idea about plugholes...",
