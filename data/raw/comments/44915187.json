The prompt is shown bellow the image, but for me the result looks closer to a prompt \"Create lifeless characters reciting marketing slop. They must fake an over exaggerated excitement but it should be clear they don't believe in what they're saying and have no souls\".Also, the prompt specifically ask \"Panel 4 should show the cat and dog high-fiving\" but the cat is high-fiving ... the cat. Personally I find this hallucinated plot twist good, it makes the ending a bit better. Although technically this is demonstrating a failure of the tool to follow the instructions from the prompt. Interesting choice of example for an official announcement.",
