In the first panel there is a stick figure man and a stick figure bird eating bird seed at his feet. He is slightly hunched over to show he is looking at the bird. In the second panel. He is more hunched over looking more closely at the bird. In the third panel he is even more hunched over practically with his head to the bird, he is crouched down, knees bent, hands on thighs. In the upper left of the third panel the tip of an enormous beak can be seen, but it's only a few lines so could be anything. In the final panel the beak has gobbled up the man and his arms and legs are flailing outside of the beak while the small bird continues to eat birdseed on the ground.\n'''",
