    "textPlain": "The webcomics is awful. It feels off, the characters look very fake, unsettling in the way they communicate. The prompt is shown bellow the image, but for me the result looks closer to a prompt \"Create lifeless characters reciting marketing slop. They must fake an over exaggerated excitement but it should be clear they don't believe in what they're saying and have no souls\".Also, the prompt specifically ask \"Panel 4 should show the cat and dog high-fiving\" but the cat is high-fiving ... the cat. Personally I find this hallucinated plot twist good, it makes the ending a bit better. Although technically this is demonstrating a failure of the tool to follow the instructions from the prompt. Interesting choice of example for an official announcement.",

    "textPlain": "I was just thinking that. It has many, many errors.1. Not seen browsing ”ai.dev”.2. The text ”Imagen 4 is now generally available!” is spoken, not a comic caption.3. Invalid second panel.4. Hallucinates ”Meet Imagen 4 fast!”5. Hallucinates ”It offers low..” etc. (this is the second part of a single sentence said by the cat)6. Hallucinates ”You can export images in 2K!” (this sentence is not asked for)7. Doesn’t have the cat and the dog in the fourth panel.—Here’s the gpt-image-1 counterpart with the issues I could find:https://chatgpt.com/s/m_689f7c4d534c8191b9bcf2b6fdc410691. The text ”Imagen 4 is now generally available!” is missing.2. ”low latency” -> ”low-laten”(3. Has that ugly gpt-image-1 trademark yellow filter.)I didn’t bring up the ”retro comic look thing”. I certainly think it’s an issue with Imagen 4’s version. It doesn’t look very old school at all. But I can’t judge the OpenAI one either on that, I’m no comic book expert, so I just skipped that one.",
