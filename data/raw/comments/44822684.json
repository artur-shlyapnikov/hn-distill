If your brain actually degenerates from usage of the ring (and is no longer used in daily life, acting only reflexively), the premise that you are the happiest from following the ring might be flat out wrong. I think happiness (I tend to think in terms of well-being, which let's say ranks every good thing you can feel, by definition -- and assume the \"good\" is something philosophically infinitely wise) is probably something like a whole-brain or at least a-lot-of-brain phenomenon. It's not just a result of what you see or what you have in life. In fact I'm sure two persons can have very similar external conditions and wildly different internal lives (for an obvious example compare the bed-ridden man who spends his day on beautiful dreams, and the other who is depressed or in despair).What the ring seems to do is to put you in situations where you would be the happiest, if only you were not wearing the earring.The earring that actually guides you toward a better inner life perhaps offers only very minimal and strategic advice. Perhaps that's what the 'Lotus octohedral earring' does :)",

But its advice is always better than what the wearer would have come up with on her own.\"I think one very simple explanation would be that this comes down to a matter of exploration vs exploitation. Since it is only giving \"better\" advice, and not even 'locally optimal', there is reason to favor exploring vs merely following the advice unquestioningly.A more complex, but ultimately comprehensive answer, is that free will consists, at least in one aspect, in the ability not only to choose one's goals or means, but also what _aspect_ of those various options to consider \"good\" or \"better\".And if one were to say that all such considerations ultimately resolve back to a fundamental desire to be \"happy\", to me, this seems to be hand-waving, rather than addressing the argument, because different people have different definitions of the \"happy\" end-state. If these differences were attributed fully to biology & environment, the story loses its impact, because there was never free will in the first place. If, while reading the story, we adopt a view that genuine free will exists, and hold some kind of agnosticism about the possible means by which that can be so, then it seems reasonable to attribute at least some of the differences in what the \"happy\" end-state looks like to the choices made by the people, themselves.Given that kind of freedom, unless one has truly perfect knowledge (beyond the partial knowledge contained in the advice of the earring), the pursuit of one's goals seems to unavoidably entail some regrets. And with perfect knowledge, well... The kind of 'freedom' attributed, for example, to God by philosophers like Thomas Aquinas, is explicitly only analogous to our own, and is understood to be an unchanging condition, rather than a sequential act.(As a final note: One might wonder what this 'f",
