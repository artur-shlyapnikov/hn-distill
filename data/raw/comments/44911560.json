Any authenticated Corp user can access the login page, and that gets logged, but the authorisation is a simple user/password.If the credential isn't secure (because people are terrible with security) then at least the attacker is logged, and has had to authorise access.Some authentication is better. Our guacamole hosts for example are authenticated on proxy with OIDC, then passed through to the guacamole server which does its own authorisation based on its internal database (which itself is managed via a github approach - to add joe.bloggs@corp.com to the \"Washington Servers\" group you add his identity to the right part of the \"groups.conf\" file and when the PR is merged it applies across the estate within a minute or two). Then they can access all connections in \"Washington\", but \"davey.jones@corp.com\" isn't in that group, so can't.Likewise our IPAM will create a user in the \"readonly\" group automatically (our policy is ip records are available to everyone in the company), but they then need moving into an elevated rights using IPAM tooling to allocate IP addresses.Vaultwarden though we maintain separate user and password, we still have the OIDC front end, but it's completely ignored for another layer of authorisation.
