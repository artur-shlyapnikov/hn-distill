    "textPlain": "Yep, exactly. I selfhost Vaultwarden and a bunch of other apps that my family also use. So I run Authentik, which lets them only have to worry about remembering one login, and they then have a little dashboard of all our apps, and can click to login to whatever they want. It's a pretty decent little system, and I'm happy I can now add Vaultwarden to it.The bigger your users x applications number, the bigger the benefit. It make user management easy (e.g., you only have to manage users in one place instead of N)",
