I hope the maintainers are doing their due diligence around securing their docker hub account (many of us run VW in docker) and are careful about libraries the project depends on. Some questionable coding practices were made that I'm not sure I agree with (calling a 3rd party sites in some scenarios). As more of us switch to self hosting VW it will become a juicer target for bad actors. Really hoping we don't wake up one day to find out that our database was uploaded by a BA",
