It is written more succinctly as \"1.2 Gm (gigametres)\". However, it is incorrect to stack prefixes like \"1.2 Mkm\".After I point this out, the usual complaints will surface: \"But no one knows what a gigametre is! We're all used to talking about odometers in only kilometres. No one uses big prefixes.\" Oh really? Are you telling me you don't know the difference between a kilobyte and a gigabyte? Should we revert to calling a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency as \"2.4 million kHz\", because kilohertz is familiar to people working with audio frequencies and AM radio?Overall, I think we should use the right prefixes for the right job. If you're talking about city blocks, use metres. If you're talking about a single trip, use kilometres. If you're talking about annual driving distance, use megametres.
