    "textPlain": "I tried this for pixel art and came away a bit disappointed. It seems to have no real support for drawing using palettes / indexed colors. Sure, you can setup or load a palette, but the drawing tools make no reference to it, and continue to colors outside of it. The color pickers don't even show the palette, they just show the full color wheel. Where is the support for dithered gradients using on palette colors? Where is the support for antialiasing using only palette colors? Maybe this is planned, but given it's already at v2.0 I'm surprised the pixel art support is so half-baked.",
