    "textPlain": "From what I've seen, the faster PCI-E bus is important when you need to shuffle things in and out of VRAM. In a video game, the faster bus reduces the duration of stutters caused by pushing more data into the graphics card.If you're using a new video card with only 8GB of onboard RAM and are turning on all the heavily-advertised bells and whistles on new games, you're going to be running out of VRAM very, very frequently. The faster bus isn't really important for higher frame rate, it makes the worst-case situations less bad.I get the impression that many reviewers aren't equipped to do the sort of review that asks questions like \"What's the intensity and frequency of the stuttering in the game?\" because that's a bit harder than just looking at average, peak, and 90% frame rates. The question \"How often do textures load at reduced resolution, or not at all?\" probably requires a human in the loop to look at the rendered output to notice those sorts of errors... which is time consuming, attention-demanding work.",
