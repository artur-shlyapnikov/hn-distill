So all the staff except a single digit few (the ones who do the compliance certification work) will probably be laid off in the not-too-distant future, regardless of whether they take the buyout.So everyone should take the it, rather than get worked to death and then unceremoniously RIF’d in a months.",

Not disputing that. But making that the default for the company culture is insane.",
