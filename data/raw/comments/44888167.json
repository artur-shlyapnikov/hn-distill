    "textPlain": "I wondered how the original was made. Did they paint the whole thing at once and then pleat it? Or was it made of two paintings that were cut up?It seems to be much simpler than that; the prisms were solid and removable. So you just put them in a rack so all of one side is flat, and paint directly on them. When that painting is done, you rotate all the prisms to the next side and do the second painting.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_scalata",

So it is entirely possible that her morphing into a skull was intentional.",

I think this is not even a good phrasing of the problem yet, but phrasing the problem well is part of the fun.I guess this could be interestingly image-dependent. In particular she’s quite pale, so I wonder how many surfaces  could be shared between the two images.",
