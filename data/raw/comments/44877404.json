    "textPlain": "I know they define \"achievements\" in order to measure \"how well\" the LLM plays the game, and by definition this is arbitrary. As an experiment, I cannot argue with this.However, I must point out the kind of \"modern\" (relatively speaking) adventure games mentioned in the article -- which are more accurately called \"interactive fiction\" by the community -- is not very suitable for this kind of experiment. Why? Well, because so many of them are exploratory/experimental, and not at all about \"winning\" (unlike, say, \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", where there is a clear goal).You cannot automate (via LLM) \"playing\" them, because they are all about the thoughts and emotions (and maybe shocked laughter) they elicit in human players. This cannot be automated.If you think I'm being snobby, consider this: the first game TFA mentions is \"9:05\". Now, you can set goals for a bot to play this game, but truly -- if you've played the game -- you know this would be completely missing the point. You cannot \"win\" this game, it's all about subverting expectations, and about replaying it once you've seen the first, most straightforward ending, and having a laugh about it.Saying more will spoil the game :)(And do note there's no such thing as \"spoiling a game\" for an LLM, which is precisely the reason they cannot truly \"play\" these games!)",

    "textPlain": "I disagree. Lockout, Dreamhold, Lost Pig, and So Far are new games but in the old style. Plundered Hearts is literally one of the old games (though ahead of its time).I'll grant you that 9:05 and For a Change are somewhat more modern: the former has easy puzzles, the latter very abstract puzzles.I disagree new text adventures are not about puzzles and winning. They come in all kinds of flavours these days. Even games like 9:05 pace their narrative with traditional puzzles, meaning we can measure forward progress just the same. And to be fair, LLMs are so bad at these games that in these articles, I'm merely trying to get them to navigate the world at all.If anything, I'd argue Adventure is a bad example of the genre you refer to. It was (by design) more of a caving simulator/sandbox with optinal loot than a game with progress toward a goal.",
