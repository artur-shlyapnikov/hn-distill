    "textPlain": "Every public school teacher I know comes home crying from time to time because of the emotional load.  The husband of my wife’s best friend is a music teacher who’s been assaulted by students multiple times.  The science teacher who inspired me to study physics showed me the classroom, years later, where he teaches, and there were so many chairs packed in I asked “has the fire marshall been here?”That is, a huge part of the job is dealing with unruly behavior and bullshit and not even instruction.  If AI is going to make a positive difference in education it’s going to have to take a bite out of that!",

    "textPlain": "I've heard similar anecdotes.  I am of the opinion that AI can't fix that.  That will require school boards and parents willing to change budget allocation to school police and local governments that implement zero tolerance on violence.  Parents of violent kids will of course get upset and emit crocodile tears because their \"little darling\" would \"never hurt anyone\".  Cameras in classrooms, body cams on teachers, school police and lock up the little darlings will take a bite out of it.  Short of that and we just lose more good teachers.  Kids can earn back camera free classrooms once the violent ones are weeded out.I would put the AI in juvenile hall to teach the violent kids.  It will be a dystopian environment but they earned it and can earn their way out of it.",
