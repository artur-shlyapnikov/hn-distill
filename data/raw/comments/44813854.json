I honestly thought it was just an experiment that got abandoned and never expected it to actually become a real product, similar to how GH Copilot Spaces was an experiment and turned into Copilot agent.It does what it wants, often just “finishes” a task preemptively and asking follow ups does nothing besides it rambling for a bit, the env sometimes doesn’t persist and stuff just stops working. For a while it just failed completely instantly because the model was dead or somethingOut of the dozen times I tried it, I think I merged maybe one of its PRs. The rest I trashed and reassigned to a different agent.My ranking- Claude Code (through gh action), no surprise there- ChatGPT Codex- GitHub Copilot Agent- JulesI will try it again today to see if the full release changed anything (they give 3 months free trial for previous testers) but if it’s the same, I wouldn’t use or pay for Jules. Just use Codex or GitHub agent. Sorry for the harsh words",

By the time I get home in the evening I've got a few PRs to review. Most of the code is useless to me, but it usually runs, and means I can jump straight into testing out the idea before going back and writing it properly myself.Next step is to add automatic builds to each PR, so that on the way home I can just check out the different branches on my phone instead of waiting to be home to run the ios simulator :D",
