So I decided I would not invest my limited time, motivation, or brain space to writing.Overall it's been a successful approach, and I recommend it to new learners unless they have a particular interest in being able to write by hand or they feel strongly that writing the characters helps them remember them.It's only rarely that I have to write anything other than my own name in Japanese. I've practiced my address but writing it in English is fine in 99% of situations. Being able to write properly would save a little embarrassment, but I still believe my language learning time would have a much higher ROI in other areas.",

The classes would have us learn writing, reading, speaking and listening (sensibly so for a Chinese language class).Being able to write characters was handy whenever I came across documents that needed to be filled, but since leaving China I never had the need to write characters again. I now just input them using pinyin on keyboards, and I can easily recognise and read / input the correct characters. It is a strange feeling trying to write the characters I once knew, but now have forgotten, yet being able to read them instantly...I would like to recommend dong-chinese, a language app I came across when I prepared for my stay over there. It taught things in a very efficient manner.At this point I would like to recreationally increase my vocabulary so I have started working on a game called LingoRogue.

I don't see the character in my mind, so it makes sense that I can't reproduce it on paper.While the author's aphantasia may have posed some recall issues - it wouldn't explain why they had ever been able to reproduce 植. Kanji has the concept of radicals AND stroke order. One could make the case that perhaps the author's motor cortex is simply storing the equivalent of LOGO programming language instructions for reproducing the logograph.Take away your mind's ability to find and chunk (木, 十, 具) by showing them \"radical\"-less characters and I'm sure it would be even more difficult.",

A friend of mine in grad school irreverently referred to the Chinese writing system as \"a really huge, really inefficient syllabary\", and I think there's some truth to that.  The characters no doubt have a certain beauty and their history is interesting, but a system where the meanings and pronunciations have to be learned totally separately seems to be inherently cumbersome in some ways.  Even in a language like English which abuses the Latin alphabet in a notoriously messy manner, the amount of phonetic information that can be gleaned from the written form is fairly high, which gives two paths to the word (via memorized whole-word recognition or incremental sounding-out).",

Therefore, a Western learner should first focus only on the meaning and writing of those couple of thousand common characters and, only after having mastered those, should move on to studying the pronunciations.Going from \"Japanese people learn the spoken language first\" to \"you should spend a big chunk of time learning characters before learning sounds, words or grammar\" is a pretty remarkable mental backflip.The author says he spent eleven months doing this before devoting any time to the spoken language.

I can draw better than average from memory, and used to be quite good but haven't practiced for many years.There are also animators and artists with aphantasia[1].My spatial recollection is particularly good - I can sketch out precise diagrammatic drawings from memory much better than I can do artistic drawings.So while it's not impossible that not having aphantasia would've been a benefit to him, I don't think there's much evidence that it's has any big effect on the ability to draw - something that also fits Ed Catmull's experience on surveying his old employees in the article mentioned.[1] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47830256",

English-speaking children can read far more advanced books earlier than equivalently educated Japanese.They probably don't outweigh the disadvantages, but there are some small benefits. Once fluent, I think I remember Japanese to be slightly faster to read because of the more unique shapes. And you can make more flexible and elegant graphic text designs and tables (like in Excel) given the compact words and natural vertical writing.",

    "textPlain": "Overall you are probably correct, but there are certain benefits from the Chinese character system.Long time ago I studied Japanese in Japan. On the way back to my home country I was sitting next to a bunch of Chinese people on the plane who did not speak any English or Japanese, but we were able to have a small conversation using Kanji/Chinese characters, because the characters' meanings are usually the same, although the languages are quite different. If the people would have been Greek and could not speak any English, no conversation would have been possible at all.Another thing to mention is the radical system. Many Chinese characters consist of two or more characters, of which one is the \"radical\". This often helps you understand the broad meaning of the character in case you do not know it. For example, the Japanese character for fish is \"魚\". If you know that character and see another unknown character that used \"fish\" as a radical (for example \"鮭\"), you know that the character probably describes some kind of fish (in this case salmon). So it is not simply a huge list of \"syllables\".",

Many people were using wa-puro (word processors that let you type in the phonetic form and choose from the appropriate kanji). I imagine the effect is far more common now.I remember one time when a university engineering professor couldn't remember how to write the kanji for \"police\". He didn't seem embarrassed asking someone else. I don't know if they still do, but they would often demonstrate by writing out the character with their index finger like a pen in the other hand's palm.",
