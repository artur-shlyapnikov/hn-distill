    "textPlain": "Kudos to the author, a very very nice overview of things!I was just at a big conference where there was now a lot of AI talk and papers etc and, as that hasn't been my area, I've been catching up.  Have been hearing so much about GNN and ensembles and things that I haven't had to think about before.  So now I'm going through this and looking up new-to-me terms.  Sweet.Now it's just to work out how to save it as an epub to browse on the beach.",

    "textPlain": "The whole article seems to hinge on the idea that cursor is unsustainable and a large driver of revenue for AI companies. It seems to think that if cursor dies, so does the revenue.I don't see that- cursor will die by losing market share, not by the death of the market. Agentic coding as a market will continue to grow and if Claude remains competitive then Anthropic will do just fine.",
