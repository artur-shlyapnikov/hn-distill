When paired with complementary techniques such as resampling, adjusting class weights, or generating synthetic data, ensemble methods can yield even more robust results in handling imbalanced datasets.",

Have been hearing so much about GNN and ensembles and things that I haven't had to think about before.  So now I'm going through this and looking up new-to-me terms.  Sweet.Now it's just to work out how to save it as an epub to browse on the beach.",
