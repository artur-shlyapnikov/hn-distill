    "textPlain": "This is all a familiar pattern. In the early days of ride share it was an amazing advancement and very cheap, because it was highly subsidized. The quality was decent, and certainly better than taxi and car services in most cities. Tons of ride share app companies popped up.Then reality set in. Costs were raised so they weren’t losing money anymore. Rideshare became more of a commodity and competitors got squeezed out as there wasn’t much room to compete and make money. Service quality went downhill. Uber is generally reliable but the quality has fallen off a cliff. My last car smelled bad and the rear axel sounded like was about to fall off the car. In most cities at the airport I just walk outside and get an old fashioned taxi at the rank vs dealing with all the nonsense regulations forcing one to walking to some remote corner of a parking garage for the “ride share pickup” zone.GenAI is entering that pivot point. The products have plateaued. There’s pressure to stop the loss leaders and set prices to a more realistic level. Services are becoming commoditized. It’s not going away but we’re entering a period of rapid consolidation. GenAI will still be here in a few years and will be useful, but like rideshare the allure will wear old and we’ll look at these things like we do spell checkers today. Something everyone uses but ultimately boring commoditized tech where there’s not a lot of money to be made. A useful feature to add to actual products.I do think there’s some good opportunity to shift to locally run small models, but that too will just become commoditized spell-checker level tech.",

    "textPlain": "I'm fairly certain these companies should pivot to selling / licensing AI \"s/w drivers\" for commodity consumer hardware that enables all these apps to run local-first or local-only.The token cost stopped decaying as expected, as mentioned by the original 100,000k post on HN, and the move nowadays is towards more context to keep building functionality. The cost is just going to go up for inference. These companies might be better off splitting their focus between training and tooling, and canning all the capex/opex associated with inferrence.Forget S/W engineers for a moment ... Every white collar worker I know, especially non technical folks, use ChatGPT all the time, and believe that is AI at this point. That demand isn't going to vanish overnight.The counter argument is usually \"They'll sell data\", but I'm not sure you can double the number of trillion dollar data companies without some dilution of the market, and reach a billion devices / users without nation-state level infra.",

AI startups burn a huge amount of money on providing free service to drive growth. That’s something they can reduce at any time without raising costs for their customers at all. Not to mention the fact that the cost of providing inference is plummeting by several orders of magnitude.Uber weren’t providing free service to huge numbers of people, so when they wanted to turn a profit they couldn’t reduce there and had to raise prices for their customers. And the fees they pay to drivers didn’t drop a thousandfold so it wasn’t getting vastly cheaper to provide service.",
