Via the detour of stable distributions and limiting distributions, this generalised central limit theorem plays an important role in the rise of power laws in physics.",

I try my best to write in a way that you understand the state of the data (hence the tables I spread throughout the post), but I do acknowledge it can be inscrutable.",
