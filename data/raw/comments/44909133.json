    "textPlain": "HighlyÂ entertaining, here a little fun fact: there exist a generalisation of the central limit theorem for distributions without find out variance.For some reasons this is much less known, also the implications are vast. Via the detour of stable distributions and limiting distributions, this generalised central limit theorem plays an important role in the rise of power laws in physics.",
