    "textPlain": "There is an analogue of the CLT for extreme values. The Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem is the extreme-values analogue of the CLT: if the properly normalized maximum of an i.i.d. sample converges, it must be Gumbel, Fréchet, or Weibull—unified as the Generalized Extreme Value distribution. Unlike the CLT, whose assumptions (in my experience) rarely hold in practice, this result is extremely general and underpins methods like wavelet thresholding and signal denoising—easy to demonstrate with a quick simulation.",
