    "textPlain": "Worth noting that division (integer, fp, and simd) has gotten much cheaper in the last decade. Common microarchitectures are partially pipelined now (capable of delivering a result every 2-4 cycles) and have greatly reduced latency from ~30-80 cycles down to ~10-20 cycles.This improvement is sufficient to tip the balance toward favoring division in some algorithms where historically programmers went out of their way to avoid it.",
