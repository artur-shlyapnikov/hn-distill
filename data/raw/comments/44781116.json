I'd meet other doctors that knew him and they'd say he's the kind of doc they'd want treating their mothers.He has never been great with computers (though he often reminds me that he successfully created a boot disk with virtual RAM to run Falcon 3.0 on my IIGS when I was a kid). He's not totally incapable of using modern tech, but I am his tech support and we still occasionally deal with basic stuff like how to forward in gmail or save a PDF on his phone.I remember when his hospital switched to EMR. It was a nightmare for the first six months, but he eventually got the hang of it. Some of the other older docs requested assistants to help them but he was stubborn and prefers self reliance if he can help it and just gutted though it.That was years ago and I far as I can tell the doctors in his circle are very used to EMR now. I hear some are even liking new AI features that listen to an appointment and automatically draft notes (that the doc obviously must review and sign off on).My dad retired this summer after more than 40 years of 60-80 hour weeks saving and improving countless lives. He still struggles with computers, but I don't know much about medicine so it's more than a fair trade of advice for me.",

He has a knack for tackling difficult medical problems.

When his hospital’s new electronic-medical-record system arrived, he immediately decided to see if he could hack the system.A great example of participatory design.",

When I switched from Kaiser to Sutter, the doctor showed me \"how easy it is to transfer my full records\" (they both have Epic, plus a custom integration).  I have no trouble communicating while they use their computer, and handle just about everything through the captive website (which is a bit slow- sometimes the pharmacy faxes a request to my doctor, who ignores faxes until I ping them).The one important thing is to know how to work the system.  Once you understand how it works, it's remarkably easy to guide your doctor or other service providers to do what you want.  I talk a lot with the doctor and my spouse (who has taught me a lot), and I also read various online forums.    Further I have no truly serious health problems that require intensive care, which could change things a lot.I understand many people feel differently, and I in no way want to invalidate their subjective experience- if you prefer paper, or find computer doctors impersonal, or anything else, I'm not here to try to convince you otherwise.",

Inconsistent widgets, some keyboard shortcuts for some dialog boxes, but not for others.  Lots of forms that need filling that I shouldn't be having to fill out (it's the same every time but I have to go through the whole process just to speak to a patient over phone).As others have mentioned here, senior doctors used to look at the patient, and give their opinion.  Admin and junior doctors would turn it into action in a safe way, following protocol and prescribing advice to make it happen.These days senior doctors are checking in their patients themselves, clicking through many menus to order blood tests, checking out their patients, writing their patient letters, and basically sorting out the majority of the admin for enacting what they recommended should happen.",

You can NEVER be good in both simultaneously.\nWhen I am with and think about patients, I cannot use a PC (in the where-is-the-poweron-button way) and when I maintain my little Github projects, I become a dangerous doctor. My ability to change my brain with an \"internal mental switch\" has improved dramatically, it happens even in minutes.A great share of my income as a doctor comes from filling medical reports on various online platforms, covering 100000 people which my other five colleagues cannot serve. The platforms are not complex, just online forms that have a lot of copy-pasting and a bunch of clicks and up-downloads. The texts are so similar that I might try to automate/-fill them, most probably with a addon. I imagine they seem awful and scary to them and I don't blame them because it is painful to write a digital medical report and do anything else except... writing.I mostly choose being in the medical state of mind because there are emergencies I must confront.

Brittleness is the inability of a system to cope with surprises, and, as we apply computers to situations that are ever more interconnected and layered, our systems are confounded by ever more surprises. By contrast, the systems theorist David Woods notes, human beings are designed to handle surprises. We’re resilient; we evolved to handle the shifting variety of a world where events routinely fall outside the boundaries of expectation. As a result, it’s the people inside organizations, not the machines, who must improvise in the face of unanticipated events.In this new age of AI, maybe we can start to reverse this trend? Make systems that can adapt and handle surprises, instead of pushing all this brittleness onto the humans using the system",

Same as anthropic \"Computer Use\", but in the traditional code. And it was written by doctor, not IT engineer.\nLater, I worked at startup that tried to create intelligent hospital bed, able to record patient heartbeat, respiration, movements without special sensors. The technical part was all good, but we failed to sell any such bed to hospitals, only a few to nursing homes. Doctors are conservative, plus anything related to medical requires a lot of certificates and compliances. Finally, we give up and made consumer device out of it - Sleep Numbers \"smart bed\".\nCompanies who sell software to doctors spend much more efforts to satisfy all requirements, and make a deal.
