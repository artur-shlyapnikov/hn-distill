    "textPlain": "Single file dependencies are amazing. I've never understood why it's so unpopular as a distribution model.They can be a bit clunky in some languages (eg. C), but even then it's nothing compared to the dystopian level of nightmare fuel that is a lot of dependency systems (eg. Maven, Gradle, PIP). Free vendoring is a nice plus as well.Lua does it right; happy to see some Fennel follow in that tradition.",
