Once inside the bladder, the TAR-200 slowly and consistently releases the gemcitabine into the organ for three weeks per treatment cycle.\"- Phase 2 Clinical Trial- 85 patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer- \"treated patients with TAR-200 every three weeks for six months, and then four times a year for the next two years\"- 70/85 patients—the cancer disappeared and still gone 1yr later in almost 50% patients- FDA granted TAR-200 a New Drug Application Priority Review- Johnson & Johnson manufactures TAR-200",

    "textPlain": "Sorta OT: I’m seriously freaking out AND depressed—reading about this seemingly incredible bladder-cancer treatment (and other breakthroughs I constantly see), and then seeing, in just the past 6+ months, funding slashed and the best students from around the world actively discouraged from coming to our top schools. It’s beyond alarming.The US is literally crushing both innovation and talent at the same time. Think of all the brilliant minds who can’t—or won’t bother—coming here to test their ideas because visas are paused, revoked, or delayed for political reasons. Worse, proposed H-1B changes favoring only high-wage workers could shut out fresh grads entirely. At this rate, funding is being starved for political concessions, and the next generation of genius scientists might be too scared—or flat-out blocked—from studying and innovating here.And it’s not just foreign students—even native US students are looking at science careers that might not exist in a few years. My wife is an accountant for research grants, and ALL her PIs are still in a daze, trying to process what’s happening.Again… depressing AF. THe US based science/research pipeline is toast.",
