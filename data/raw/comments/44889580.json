It’s beyond alarming.The US is literally crushing both innovation and talent at the same time. Think of all the brilliant minds who can’t—or won’t bother—coming here to test their ideas because visas are paused, revoked, or delayed for political reasons. Worse, proposed H-1B changes favoring only high-wage workers could shut out fresh grads entirely. At this rate, funding is being starved for political concessions, and the next generation of genius scientists might be too scared—or flat-out blocked—from studying and innovating here.And it’s not just foreign students—even native US students are looking at science careers that might not exist in a few years. My wife is an accountant for research grants, and ALL her PIs are still in a daze, trying to process what’s happening.Again… depressing AF. THe US based science/research pipeline is toast.",
