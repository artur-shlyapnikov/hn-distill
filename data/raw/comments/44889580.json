    "textPlain": "Some important things not mentioned in this press release (not to detract from the idea of new treatment approaches of any sort):- All patients had their tumors surgically removed before they were started on treatment. Thus the trial wasn't testing cure so much as delay of recurrence.- These are very superficial tumors, meaning they were growing on the very surface of the inner bladder surface, just like skin tags. These aren't the ones that kill people. Patients who don't respond to BCG can be treated for quite a while just by having them surgically removed if they recur (using a minimally-invasive procedure known as a transurethral resection of bladder tumors, TURBT).- Fun with words: the press release called this a clinical trial, but it's not -- it has no controls, no real statistics, no randomization, none of the things that make up the usual standard in medicine. The authors of the paper call it a study, which is basically a research experiment. They don't use the word \"trial\" at all in the paper.Having said all that, I still look forward to seeing a proper trial.",
