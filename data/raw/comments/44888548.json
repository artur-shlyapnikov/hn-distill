    "textPlain": "Nothing too surprising more or less same thing as all other vertical columns.\n546=2*3*7*13 and all numbers in the range [242, 250] can be divided by one of those 4 primes same for [296, 304] . If x is divisor of a and b, then it will also divide a+n*b meaning you get an empty column. 2 and 3 already makes more than half the columns non primes, fill in the gaps with few more primes and you get the wide empty columns. If the width is multiple of many different small primes it's more likely to happen.In a similar way 210=2*3*7*5 also gives wide empty columns (if you ignore ignore first row where 2,3,5,7 themselves are primes)It helps if you think of it in terms of where the non primes are located instead of where the primes are. Multiples of 2, 3, 5 form a very regular pattern. Wrap it around in a grid and you get straight lines which are either straight vertical or slightly shifted depending on the divisors of width. Stack a couple of repetitive patterns and you still get a repetitive pattern.  If the positions which are not primes form a regular pattern, the inverted image also forms recognizable pattern. Of course the primes don't form perfectly regular pattern and but most the visible repetition are result of small prime multiples.",

    "textPlain": "The reason behind that is similar to how all prime numbers above 2 are of the form 2n+1 since all other numbers are divisible by 2. Eg. all prime numbers >2 are odd.In this case you're seeing the extension of this to include multiples of 3. That is, all prime numbers above 6 are of the form 6n+1 or 6n+5, all other numbers are either divisible by 2 or 3.You can extend these patterns. Whenever you have a composite number you'll get periodic points where factors are known. Eg. to extend it one step further you could say all prime numbers above 30 are of the form 30n + [1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29], all others are divisible by 2, 3 or 5.From this you can also quickly iterate towards to the prime number formula for the frequency of primes. eg. Only half of numbers above 2 can be prime (1/2), the rest are multiples of 2. Over 6 you have half of two thirds of numbers that can possibly be prime, the rest are multiples of 2 or 3. Over 30 only 1/2 x 2/3 x 4/5 could possibly be prime. etc. This converges to the prime number theorem!Anyway if anyone ever expresses amazement that's good to see but mathematically it's well known. Prime numbers have patterns in their frequency, specifically where there's period multiples of factors there can't possibly be primes. It's the basis for prime number theory and patterns in primes have been known since Erasthosenes was back in BC times. So if you see a pattern here just remember that the pattern comes from looking at a period of a composite number and within that composite number there's guaranteed periodic gaps in primes where the factors of that number repeat.This btw is something mathematicians deal with a lot. People seem to think prime numbers have no patterns and any view of them that reveals patterns is a surprising which is a weird misconception. Prime numbers absolutely have patterns. It's the basis for prime number theory.",
