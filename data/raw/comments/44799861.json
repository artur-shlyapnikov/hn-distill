    "textPlain": "It's also getting a lot flakier. Around October or November of last year I realized that every week I see another bit of SPA jankiness. I lose my scroll position because some component has appeared or disappeared above view. The issues list shows hours-old state and does not refresh. A button doesn't work. A page loads but everything below the header is unstyled. I expand the build details but it collapses closed every time a stage finishes. A filename header appears twice. New comments don't appear. On and on.It's very frustrating to have a tool that has spent 15 years fading into the background of reliable infrastructure become an intrusive, distracting mess.After a couple months with jujutsu it's almost completely replaced my use of git.  It’s a lot to hope for, but just as jujutsu surveyed a couple decades of VCS to syncretize a huge improvement, I do hope someone will do the same for collaborating with jujutsu. GitHub PRs feel very unfortunately frozen in amber because their popularity makes it very hard to fix the core UI design problems it has with multiple tabs, incoherent timeline, edited commits, missing \"8 more comments\", and now a steady drip of SPA jank.The big remaining feature of GitHub is the network effect of coworkers and potential contributors already being logged in, and there could be a race between a competitor neutralizing that with bidirectional sync (see git-bug) and GitHub getting their usability problems sorted. Microsoft's legendary resistance to breaking changes means there's a very big window available.",
