    "textPlain": "TLDR: Curl has been around for 10,000 days and they’re collecting user stories.Back in the 00s we had a misbehaving application distributed on about 20 servers that would go haywire from time to time. I built a server monitoring solution consisting of a cgi bin shell script that cat’d a bunch of /proc info together, then curled them from a central server and formatted into an html page that one could  refresh every few seconds to monitor server health. Then I could go in and restart the node before the business users started screaming. They were too cheap to buy an existing solution to do this.Don’t miss those days at all.",
