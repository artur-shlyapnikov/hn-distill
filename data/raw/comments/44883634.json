They might have invalidated a European registered trademark, but you have first use and continuous worldwide use which means a lot. Not all trademarks need to be registered. Again, IANAL, but I can't imagine they can harass you with their mark. They just formally made the case that your usage wasn't in the relevant market, and in the case of the US mark, that their usage is somehow substantially different from yours. This will make it nearly impossible for them to now argue your usage is competitive/conflicting. Them taking action would likely have some risk for them; their lawyers would likely advise against it. They probably won't do anything now that they have what they wanted.More generally: don't treat the lack of registered mark as something you need to act on. You were doing your thing just fine without a registered trademark in the other ~180 countries. Just keep doing what you're doing.Fighting it will be painful, expensive, stressful and unrewarding.

Not completely unheard of, but still rare.I don't know why you decided to trademark your project name, but I think the biggest issue here is that trademark law is naturally  the domain of IP rightsholders and an outlook that presumes and enforces scarcity when it comes to names, name spaces, and digital content.There aren't that many reasons why FLOSS projects need to work within that same domain. My thought is that it is better to try and defend the environment of a digital commons that exists outside of them, than to enter into it and try to participate in a quite alien system of existing IP law, which has a lot of presumptions and standards that, as you say, don't really match the world you work within.",

A hand-rolled lightning-fast Typescript compiler that emits the runtime reflection capabilities? Full-fledged DI as an inherent part of the design, not an afterthought?It's such an incredible blend of beautiful tooling with pragmatic applications.For anyone curious about this, https://web.archive.org/web/20230916074647/https://deepkit.i... is a fascinating read.https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/47658#issueco... provides context on why some of TypeScript's design goals around erasure hold it back from these features.

There's all this talk from proponents about how it protects the little guys from abuse by big corporations, yet in reality it's the exact opposite every single time. Rights are taken away from the public with the force of the law while big businesses trample on the law to steal from individuals. For all the talk here about the best course of action being to \"just\" give in, things will keep getting progressively worse until there is collective action.",

    "textPlain": "I’m almost 100% in agreement, but context matters, and attitude matters.If you’re up against a behemoth, figure out how to get out ASAP.But I’ve learned that small claims lawsuits can actually be quite fun! Earlier this year I sued a former landlord in small claims court. He had entered my rented space while I was away (without notice, multiple times) and then refused to return my security deposit when I moved out.I went into it with a “let’s have fun and learn” attitude. I had never sued someone and I’d never represented myself in court. I read a lot, had some good conversations with LLMs (and then fact-checked them!) about the laws and case history in my area, then filed my suit.After he dodged the summons three times, I discovered I could file a motion for alternative service (post on his front door, post in a newspaper, etc). When I went to court to argue for that motion, he actually showed up in court! So I asked the judge if he could be served right there, and he was!Our trial was highly entertaining, I caught him in a bald-faced lie, then looked at the judge and said I’m not sure how both of these things he said could be true, I can’t figure out how it adds up but maybe you can.I won the case, the judge awarded me less than I was asking for, but more than I was actually owed.I was kinda hoping he would not pay (that’s common) in which case I was looking forward to learning about how to garnish his wages or put a lien on his property. But he’s actually paying me in monthly installments for the next very many months. He could pay me all at once so he’s being a bit of a jerk, but at least he’s paying.All-in-all, I knew I had a solid case, had fun along the way, and didn’t spend more than a few bucks on court fees. In that specific context, it made sense for me and I’m happy I did it.",
