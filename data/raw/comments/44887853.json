The very first Pebble was actually instrumental in building digitalocean - I met them at MLH hackathon at CalTech and forced one of the founders to sell me a demo unit- all I used it for was notifications on the digitalocean twitter and outages pushed from slack, I tried to reply to every single tweet at us immediately. A little memento of when I hired Mikeal Rogers: https://s.h4x.club/4guEJN95Funny, now in 2025, 10 years later, I'm not a fan of smart watches due to their enabling bad habits, think I'll pick up this pebble and leave notifications turned off this time. :)",

However, it did have a compass along with a barometer, alongside HR/activity/sleep tracking.I was (and still am) sad when my watch broke (screen pops out, known failure mode).Since then I got a basic Band (7), and very recently, the Amazfit Active 2.The latter is amazing on many aspects. Every sensor mentioned above of course, but a few nice add ons like continuous barometer readings for storm warnings, a thermometer, and so on.What it notably does not have, s nither the transflective screen, nor the week to month(s) long battery life.I searched a good bit for transflective watches, and it seems garmin is the only half-decent brand in town, and they appear to paywall nicer features to their expensive products.In the absence of much of a budget, my choice was easy. But I really hope Pebble makes something in a single package that makes my next watch purchase a real dilemma if not an outright purchase :)",

Navigation and tracking of hikes and other daytime outdoor activity is my use case.Automatic illumination has never worked well for me on any watch. It seems I just don't roll my wrist to view the screen the way other people do, so this heuristic fails badly for me. I often read my watches via ambient light and the light hasn't triggered or comes later after I've already seen what I want. And on the other hand, I get annoyed by false-positives where it just lights up randomly in my peripheral vision. So I often disable the automatic light feature.So, I enjoy the always-on but passive aspect of a transflective LCD display. It is practical like a conventional watch with physical hands. It works well in bright sunlight, well enough in other decently lit environments, and at least copes with dark via the backlight. I wish it was even more reflective for low light, but the recent LCDs are not bad.I vastly prefer my Garmin FR255 which seems like the last of its breed. Garmin may have lost me as a repeat buyer with the changing products. I think I'd like their Enduro line, but not at those prices.

    "textPlain": "Garmins are incredibly expensive and not everyone wants a fitness tracker. Garmin's UX is also very disjointed between devices for how expensive they are. Plus, battery life tends to be garbage for smartwatches. I just sold my Apple Watch for a Coros because I was tired of trading battery life for features I didn't want/use and Garmins also require yet another subscription for some features. As someone who just spent the last month deciding on a new fitness wearable, much of the market is full of bloated devices that don't do everything right, but instead do a handful of things right with a laundry list of caveats.There's still a strong market for dumb watches too, so a long-lasting \"smart\" device that does some things but not as much as an Apple Watch, Garmin, Coros, etc while still serving as a general information displaying wearable sounded enticing. Unfortunately Apple's lockdown of the iPhone for the previous Pebbles (which I think might still be a thing) and my need for fitness tracking are what prevented me from buying a Pebble.",

    "textPlain": "Citation needed; that Garmin watch cited claims about 30 hours of life unless the screen is mostly off and you severely hamper the features (i.e. \"smartwatch mode\"). I wont doubt you can get it to last weeks like that.These devices are able to always show the display, don't need to turn off features, can still show notifications, etc.",

    "textPlain": "Personally, I try not to use screens for a few hours before going to bed. Before bedtime, I limit myself to my e-ink book reader.The idea of having a screen on my wrist doesn't particularly appeal to me.My partner has one and when they turn over in bed, I am sometimes blinded by the screen which still glows brightly even at the lowest setting in complete darkness.That's why I'm considering a e-ink watch. The reason I didn't commit yet is that I fear that notifications and such before bedtime could be just as harmful to my nightline peacefulness.",

    "textPlain": "Agree with sibling comments, but I think it's a bad choice of comparison.I'm a Garmin Venu fan, but... apparently it was a $350 watch[0], and now there's a $450 version[1] and an $800 version[2]. There's still an older one[3] available for $250 (or ~$185 on Amazon). Though I got my original Venu \"refurbished\" for under $100 (and it still had all the plastic wrap, etc. so was truly \"like new.\")10-11 day battery when new (mine gets 6-7 days after several years of use, but I have never used always-on-display.)If I can get a Venu 2/2S/2S Plus/3/3S as a refurbished watch for ~$200-250, then I would go that route over an inexpensive Pebble 2 Time. Love that OLED screen. But I totally get the hacker ethos favoring the Pebble OS over Garmin. (Garmin does have a pretty good watch OS, and most things work without a subscription, which was a major factor in my purchase.) For $450 (or more...) it is not comparable to Pebble's offering.[0] https://www.techradar.com/reviews/garmin-venu[1] https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/873008/[2] https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1510465/[3] https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/801643/pn/010-02701-00/",
