    "textPlain": "Wait, is this CLI or is this a github action or is this a github application?Also, I thought Jules was the \"coding agent\" they are working on. Now this is taking it over or is this like another case of Google self-competing?Someone needs to take charge at this company with a strong vision, because they are all over the place and spreading themselves thin, which in turn spreads thin the customer/brand equity.At this point, as someone who:\n- Has been writing Android code for about 13 years now- Has collaborated with Google on stuff- Lead Google developer communities and conferences- Knows many, many GDE's and has discussions with them often- Uses Gemini API for their productI'm so damn confused. How is a normal customer expected to understand then?- They have 2 SDK's for communicating to their Gemini API.- The documentation is spread and thrown all over the place.- Half the time I'm trying to do something I have to dig through their code to find how to.- The features I really want are rate limited or available only to private testers.- They have 3 coding agents now.- Even thought they have access to my Google Account and my phone, their Gemini app is useless.- I tried to do a basic thing (add a service account) in Google Cloud recently, which wasn't allowed due to default rules that are deprecated and are so confusing to change due to their confusing UX.The only usable thing is the AI studio, which is a great tool for experimenting with diff models and improved the DX of getting a Gemini API key by a mile.I'd say congrats on the release, but honestly this is such a mid low hanging fruit of a product.",

Having to scrape away buzzwords, ill-conceived descriptions, and unnecessary verbose stuff... it's tiresome.So i THINK this is what it IS:A GitHub Action that can be included in GitHub workflow YAML files. It executes the Gemini CLI, passing in prompts, repo context, and event data (like issue text or PR diffs) to generate responses or perform actions. In other words: it's a wrapper that installs and runs the Gemini CLI inside GitHub Actions environments.It can use GitHub's API (via tokens or apps) to read repo data (issues, PRs, code) and write back (e.g., add labels, comments, or code suggestions). It makes calls to standard HTTPS API endpoints for Gemini LLM\" (via the CLI's backend interactions with Google's Gemini API)",

The website Agent is definitely dumber than the vscode agent (because it has to spend 20 minutes figuring out how to build and start my monorepo apps) but on the flip side, it doesn't take up my computer and thus any value it creates is additive.We have tried out Gemini code review vs Copilot code review and Gemini is consistently offering better code review tips. It has officially caught multiple potential bugs, even a few that reviewers might have missed, so it's definitely been additive.Observability looks way worse. Github Agent has a full UX built into the Github PR that lets you dig into the agent behavior. This requires you to egress text logs and make sense of it yourself.Also curious about customization. Github just rolled out \"agent writes its own instructions\" https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-06-copilot-coding-agen... which is super cool, how do I customize this one and teach it how to start and manage apps across my monorepo?",

INSTEAD, Gemini dumped the list into Google Keep, albeit with terrible formatting. Didn't miss a single item, but did not recognize categories of item (produce vs frozen food, for example)So my read on it is there's a lot of \"rough around the edges\" use cases which can be tidied with better prompting/context or just Gemini team prioritizing those things when they get around to it.What they actually _need_ is a marketing team showing off useful applications of the releases more often. OpenAI is ALL OVER TIKTOK and people I meet under 30 on that platform don't even know gemini exists.
