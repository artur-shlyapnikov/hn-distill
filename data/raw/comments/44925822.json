    "textPlain": "Yea this article is bizarre, as it continually describes having roommates as if it was something unheard of before it \"started in Denmark in the freewheeling 1960s and ’70s\".I also don't really buy the logic of why this hasn't spread in America (despite having multiple houses in my neighborhood filled with gradstudents):> the model has been slower to spread, because Americans typically see their home as a primary store of wealthI think it has less to do with seeing the home as a store of wealth than that having roommates is more often than not a pain and most people go on to have family in which case you already have people filling up all the rooms.The main difference seems to be that it involves older people, but this speaks more to trends in starting a family later or not at all rather than anything to do with this remarkable new Danish discovery.",
