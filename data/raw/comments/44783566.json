And their \"solution\" is to turn the world into a big Disney theme park where there's no sex, drugs, or rock 'n roll. You may not mind that world, hell, you may even WANT that world, but it's completely impractical and these investors are too stupid to realize that their initial success (pressuring Steam to remove incest-themed games) won't translate into long-term success.
