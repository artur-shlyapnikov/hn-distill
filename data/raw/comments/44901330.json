They are one of the main suppliers for equipment and consumables for large-scale offset printing used in books, magazines, and stuff.* Advanced materials and chemicals. They even have an FDA-registered pharmaceutical manufacturing facility.* Film and industrial film production.* Brand licensing and partnerships.I think that while film has a bit of a comeback due to its nostalgia factor, it's always going to be relegated to a handful of niche applications. Meanwhile, I don't see Kodak getting back into consumer photography, much as I love photography, since it's a low margin and increasingly niche business. Also, they sold off their medical imaging division in 2007.I miss those Kodak CCDs.",

    "textPlain": "Matt Levine - that's impossibly high standards... but here's an attempt:If a business shuts down, the assets on its book have to be written down to what you could get in a quick sale, their liquidation value, minus the costs of closing shop. And of course, once you’re closed, there’s no more income.The standard assumption for bookkeeping is that the business will keep operating. This is the \"going concern\" assumption, and it lets you value the assets as part of the ongoing business. Switching from \"going concern\" to liquidation accounting drops the book value, maybe a lot.If there's debt coming due in the near future that the business can't repay, the survival of the business is in question.  An accountant would then have to issue a \"going concern\" warning. That is, however, not a prediction of doom.Here's Kodak's Q10 form, with the \"going concern\" note on page 8:\nhttps://investor.kodak.com/static-files/17a780a0-cd47-4128-8...Looks like they have some debt coming due, but expect to get a cash boost from terminating their pension plan (after meeting all their obligations). So the company plans to continue their business, and is confident that they will.But that is technically predicated on certain conditions (being able to roll over some debt, getting that cash as anticipated) that's not entirely under Kodak's control, and so there is that going concern warning: we think it'll be fine, but we still have to tell you.Apparently that was misunderstood as a prediction of bankruptcy or intention to close shop.",
