    "textPlain": "I wonder what the actual strategies are that Kodak can use to turn around their business? I think currently their revenue streams are:* Commercial printing and imaging. They are one of the main suppliers for equipment and consumables for large-scale offset printing used in books, magazines, and stuff.* Advanced materials and chemicals. They even have an FDA-registered pharmaceutical manufacturing facility.* Film and industrial film production.* Brand licensing and partnerships.I think that while film has a bit of a comeback due to its nostalgia factor, it's always going to be relegated to a handful of niche applications. Meanwhile, I don't see Kodak getting back into consumer photography, much as I love photography, since it's a low margin and increasingly niche business. Also, they sold off their medical imaging division in 2007.I miss those Kodak CCDs.",

It has caused a lot of confusion for many companies and there's no need for it whatsoever. They can completely replace the term with something else like \"Continuing Operations\".

These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak’s ability to continue as a going concern.I'm not sure using more modern language would have cleared up any confusion here. \"These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak’s ability to continue operations\" is no less scary.The \"confusion\" (according to Kodak) arises from the fact that the accountants did not consider (or considered and then discounted) the fact that Kodak apparently intends to put in place financing to help it repay or roll over its debts before they fall due. I'm not an accountant but I'm sure there are many rules around what they can and cannot consider before including such a statement.Clearly, reporting that Kodak is about to go bankrupt simply based on that statement is jumping the gun. But I'm not sure there is anything particularly wrong with the statement itself. It seems to me like a credit crunch or even a spike in interest rates could derail Kodak's refinancing plans and what would happen then?",
