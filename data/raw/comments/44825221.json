But if I look into the GitHub repos (https://github.com/evanrolfe/trayce_agent and https://github.com/evanrolfe/trayce_gui), the license is GPL 3? So why do I need to purchase a license?",

Most of those apps can only monitor HTTP using a proxy. Trayce does not use a proxy, it reads the traffic from the kernel layer.- UI is based on Flutter, not Electron or any other browser-based framework.- Local git-friendly HTTP request storage",
