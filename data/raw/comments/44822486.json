McKinsey consultants are paid to say the things that corporate leadership doesn't want to say.The entire role of a consultant is the create theater to present the illusion that they are doing serious \"business\". Look how professional they are? If they get it wrong, then maybe nobody can get it right. Worst case we can shake our finger at them and frown, can you believe how they handled those layoffs? ... then call them back next month when it needs to be done again.Everything goes right? Well, what great leadership this corporation has. Either way McKinsey gains a good reputation around other corporate leaders in need of these services.AI is not replacing that particular service anytime soon.",
