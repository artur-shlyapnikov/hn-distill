    "textPlain": "> “Billing isn't just about sending an invoice to your customer. It's the lifeblood of your business.”Oh. You don’t say?Continues to say billing is “tough”, but this text seems aimed to wrap it all up in one blog post.This reads like what you write to convince a small business to hire you as an independent contractor to do their website—sympathize to the emotional pain, then write a survey of challenges to convey knowledge and competence.Something is still missing as a marketing piece. First, what’s the context—compared to what?  Second, this reads like a rational discussion of complexity, but not of difficulty. So what is the author’s challenge? Write the whole code base? Integrate different  solutions? What can’t be done with time and diligence?Not for nothing, this is a timely topic for me. I was chatting with someone about outside service versus custom built solutions. This reads like someone I might be asked to consider to hire, but this isn’t the text that makes me interested to learn more.",

As well as the complexities in the article, some of the logic required can result in rather exotic SQL.Answering questions like \"what was the maximum number of concurrent sessions per account between these two dates\" with a SQL query is interesting. Making it perform properly adds a layer of fun.",

Basically, we get an arbitrary commission from an insurer, and split it between the broker, me, and possibly a referrer. The payment rules are different for us (one-off percentage plus monthly) and the referrer (fixed one-off). We need invoices for everything, and VAT in most cases.I dread working on this.",
