Having read the obituary, I understand better now why I sensed so much goodness and positive energy from only a couple of paragraphs.Hack is a beautiful font, long time user since its inception. I even use it in the terminal. Any other fonts I tried always felt slightly off for some reason and I keep going back to Hack. Knowing he had a hand in it, I'll give Google Sans Code a try.",
