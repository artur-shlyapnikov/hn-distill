It's only by looking in details at contact information that there are some things that look off (one common thing is that they may encourage bank transfers since there's no buyer protection there, but it's not always the case).A 75% market rate is not crazy \"too good to be true\" thing, it's in the realm of what a legitimate business can do, and with the prices of the items being in the 1000s, that means any hooked victim is a good catch.\nA particular example was a website copying the one for a massive discount appliance store chain in the Netherlands. \nThey had a close domain name, even though the website looked different, so any Google search linked it towards the legitimate business.You really have to apply a high level of scrutiny, or understand that Google is basically a scam registry.",
