    "textPlain": "There are \"they\"s coming up repeatedly in this discussion.I think that it's important to remember that Debian Hurd is not some massive project with thousands of anonymous people behind it.  Like Tribblix and Peter Tribble, Debian Hurd's driving force is someone whom you can name: Samuel Thibault.And although there are a few others that appear on the debian-hurd mailing list from time to time, it is amply clear that this is one of those (many) projects with a core group of very few dedicated people, with very limited resources for development and testing.  There is no many hands making light work, here.This isn't Debian as you may know it for other kernels.  (-:* https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2025/07/maillist.htmlSo, in some ways, if microkernels interest you, Debian Hurd is a place to contribute where the ground has yet to be completely trodden.",

I don't know much about kernel design so I'm speaking out of my ass here, but I've always thought that the microkernel design was more elegant than the monolithic thing we ended up with. I don't know that the alternate universe would be \"better\", and maybe realistically a design like Hurd would never be able to take over the world like Linux, but it always seemed cooler to me.I honestly didn't really realize that they were still working on Hurd.  Does anyone here use it for anything?",

    "textPlain": "I have not followed Hurd since ~2010 when development stalled, what is the purpose of Hurd at this point? Is it just hobbyists having fun and exploring the possibilities or are they still trying to become a viable option or something else or a little of a bunch of things? I think I will try installing Debian GNU/Hurd on an old laptop, always wanted to play with Hurd but I never succeeded in getting any computer I had to boot up with it and never had interest in running OSes in VMs.Years ago I was met with derisive laughter from everyone when I said Haiku would hit 1.0 before Hurd. I also said that Haiku would beat linux to the opensource desktop widely used by the average person who is not concerned with opensource, but I think that was mostly stirring the pot because of the reaction to my previous statement. All these years later and Haiku hitting 1.0 seems inevitable and even the idea of it becoming a widely adopted opensource OS does not seem that far fetched. I would like to see Hurd hit 1.0, but I am fairly skeptical at this point.I suppose ChromeOS/linux beat Haiku to the punch for the opensource desktop, but I think I will stick to my guns on this one and play semantics, many in the linux/oss view ChromeOS as linux/oss in name only. A cheat but I think Haiku has earned it.Edit: Forgot that Chomium was opensource but ChromeOS is not, so I guess I had no need to play semantics.",

He shared this (re-shared with permission but anonymously as he's still somewhat involved in GNU projects), which is just one guy's perspective of course.  Would love to hear from others if this echoes their experiences.> GNU is full of brilliant people who can write great code, but there are a few issues that I don't see fixing:  Rampant disagreement and individuals who like to work solo.  This can be good sometimes, but for a project with that scope it just isn't possible.  The group is also aging and isn't getting new blood.  This can be good because people have more free time, but it also traps us in old familiar/comfortable patterns that make onboarding younger contributors even more difficult than it already is.  The philosophy is also quite rigid.  For good reasons I think as more \"permissive\" licenses have been used to abuse users extensively, but the limitations do come up quite a bit, mainly with adoption.  I think too many people are just scarred still from an earlier world where proprietary was often the only real alternative, and change is hard.",
