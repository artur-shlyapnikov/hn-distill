Like Tribblix and Peter Tribble, Debian Hurd's driving force is someone whom you can name: Samuel Thibault.And although there are a few others that appear on the debian-hurd mailing list from time to time, it is amply clear that this is one of those (many) projects with a core group of very few dedicated people, with very limited resources for development and testing.  There is no many hands making light work, here.This isn't Debian as you may know it for other kernels.  (-:* https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2025/07/maillist.htmlSo, in some ways, if microkernels interest you, Debian Hurd is a place to contribute where the ground has yet to be completely trodden.",

I don't know much about kernel design so I'm speaking out of my ass here, but I've always thought that the microkernel design was more elegant than the monolithic thing we ended up with. I don't know that the alternate universe would be \"better\", and maybe realistically a design like Hurd would never be able to take over the world like Linux, but it always seemed cooler to me.I honestly didn't really realize that they were still working on Hurd.

Is it just hobbyists having fun and exploring the possibilities or are they still trying to become a viable option or something else or a little of a bunch of things? I think I will try installing Debian GNU/Hurd on an old laptop, always wanted to play with Hurd but I never succeeded in getting any computer I had to boot up with it and never had interest in running OSes in VMs.Years ago I was met with derisive laughter from everyone when I said Haiku would hit 1.0 before Hurd. I also said that Haiku would beat linux to the opensource desktop widely used by the average person who is not concerned with opensource, but I think that was mostly stirring the pot because of the reaction to my previous statement. All these years later and Haiku hitting 1.0 seems inevitable and even the idea of it becoming a widely adopted opensource OS does not seem that far fetched. I would like to see Hurd hit 1.0, but I am fairly skeptical at this point.I suppose ChromeOS/linux beat Haiku to the punch for the opensource desktop, but I think I will stick to my guns on this one and play semantics, many in the linux/oss view ChromeOS as linux/oss in name only. A cheat but I think Haiku has earned it.Edit: Forgot that Chomium was opensource but ChromeOS is not, so I guess I had no need to play semantics.",

    "textPlain": "Hurd predates Linux by about a year, but was under stop/start development for several years before that too.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd  It's as old as dirt, in computing terms.  It was intended to be the final part of a fully GNU based operating system, everything else having been created by that stage.Stallman et. al. have promised since the late 80s that this would be the future, and at various stages promised that it will be ready for production work within the next year (or two).  Like any promises made by Elon Musk, everyone in the tech industry has long since learned to ignore them.  Maybe some day it'll be done, but I'm highly skeptical it has any chance of building up the momentum it needs.",

Pretty succesful (expensive though) because they do not release 1000 different systems each year but 2-3.Also, you do not have to support every system.For example if they support these cheap n150 mini pcs, I am more than fine. Something common.Macos runs fine because it works in a specific space.",
