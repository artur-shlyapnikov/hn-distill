    "textPlain": "Some highlights from this release are listed here[1].The best part of Gleam in my opinion is the language's design. It's just so elegant to read and write. Take this example code snippet from the release notes:    pub fn find_book() -> Result(Book, LibraryError) {\n      case ask_for_isbn() {\n        Error(error) -> Error(error)\n        Ok(isbn) -> load_book(isbn)\n      }\n    }\n\nIt's a trivial code snippet, but I'm finding this kind of \"first class\" pattern matching produces very readable, elegant-looking, well organized code.There was a discussion the other day about the pipe operator being added to PHP 8.x. Gleam was my first language which included a pipe operator. Now, having used it a bit, I feel every language should have something like it.    pub fn hello_test() {\n      telephone.ring()\n      |> should.equal(\"Hello, Joe!\")\n    }\n\nThe pipe skips so much boilerplate and clearly communicates intent. Absolutely love it.[1] https://gleam.run/news/no-more-dependency-management-headach...",

    "textPlain": "I really like gleam. I have a few unfinished side projects in gleam with about 10k lines of code, so I've had enough of a taste to know I like it. I can't wait to see how it matures. I plan to write more gleam in the future. I am particularly excited about the possibilities of sharing more code between webapp frontends and backends. Gleam has so much potential and is already quite productive.I am not that online of a person. But I joined the discord to say hi and ask a few questions and I have to say the community really does have great vibes. If I were spending more time online, I would likely bias to spending it in the gleam community. They're a bunch of very friendly, and smart people working on a wide variety of interesting projects.",

People from around the world, of all backgrounds, genders, and experience levels are welcome and respected equally. See our community code of conduct for more. Black lives matter. Trans rights are human rights. No nazi bullsh*t.On one hand I applaud that their community standards are inclusive, but on the other hand, it shouldn't be that blatantly ideological from the get go. It's just another programming language, not a political platform.",
