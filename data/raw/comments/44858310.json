If all continues to go well, I'll be done in 3.5 years, all while working full time.So that's another option to consider: do the CS degree part-time while working on breaking into the industry. You can adjust your workload each semester depending on circumstances, so it's flexible for someone job hunting.[1] https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-compute...",

It was the best decision I've ever made, and our tuition was only CAD 5000 per year.I don't know. Some people will do better if they follow the established path. Others blaze their own trail and don't do well in rigid environments. I know I did not.Ten years later, the best part of my studies are the ones that felt like a distraction and a waste of time back then: mandatory engineering and liberal arts classes. I would have learned programming on my own either way, but these other things added so much depth to my life!I think that there are so many ways to live your twenties and grow as a human and as a professional. I strongly doubt that saddling yourself with debt is the best way to do it. Given four years of your full attention, you can achieve so much more, provided that you have the curiosity and discipline to try. I just wonder where the strength to explore the world beyond your main interest would come from.",

If he's designing PCBs of his own, he may be interested in EE or CMPE as a major (and if he does CMPE, depending on the school, it's already effectively a CS minor). Programming is relatively easy to get into without a degree or with an unrelated degree, other disciplines are much more difficult to break into without the diploma.If he's actually interested in CS, then a CS degree (or minor) makes sense. If he's interested in programming, study just about anything else and minor in CS or double major. Being an AE or MechE that has a much better than average (for the discipline) grasp on programming is a better edge career wise.",

This also allows your son to buy some time and assess the state of the market two years from now.  Two years of community college tuition is much lower than two years of university tuition, and depending on the state it might even be tuition-free.If your son is still in high school, I also highly recommend he take Advanced Placement tests and score sufficiently well on them so that way he will get college credit for those courses.

Even at a decent school, the top level classes walked me through algorithms, compilers, operating systems, and graphics in a way I might not have done myself. Plus, the best people in my class were great, and discussing how to problem solve with them for coursework was very very helpful. The whole thing was very helpful as practice in a bunch of different areas of CS.On the practical end, your degree is still a big filter for how companies screen applicants. A lack of a CS degree makes it way more difficult to get in the door. I know there are counterexamples, but 99% of my coworkers had CS degrees. Unless the money is a huge burden, or the school you would go to really is crap, then yeah, the degree makes the rest of the journey much easier.As advice, try to get evaluated out of the intro courses and skip to higher level stuff. Often if you can show a prof that you can program (before the school year begins) you can place right into a course that is at your level.The AI arguments are also facile. A CS degree is still the best training to be ready to use AI effectively. You understand more about how it is built than everyone else, plus you know way more about every tool surrounding the AI, and would have an easier time making your own.I know some people have success with alternative paths. But the main road is the main road for a reason here.Edit: Please also look at the best schools for CS, and don't just discard them as options. My coworkers out of these schools got even more out of their classes and costudents than I did. Your son sounds talented, and the best schools can help talent go even further.",
