What you're referring to as GE Coffeemattic PC, is in fact, GNU/GE Coffeemattic PC, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus GE coffeemattic. GE Coffeemattic is not a PC unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full PC as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which pumps hot java today is often called \"GE Coffeematic PC\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a GE Coffeemattic exists, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. GE Coffeematic is the coffee kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's caffeinated resources to the other the user's physical space. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Coffeemattic is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Coffeemattic added, or GNU/GE Coffeemattic. All the so-called \"GE Coffeemattic PC\" distributions are really distributions of GNU/GE Coffeemattic PC.",
