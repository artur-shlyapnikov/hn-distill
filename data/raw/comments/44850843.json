    "textPlain": "The intention was to prevent tooth decay by regulating candy intake. But it turns out that mandating a special weekly(!) day for candy consumption had the opposite effect. Children are naturally interested in things that are forbidden from them, and so when the restrictions are lifted they tend to eat large amounts of candy. Furthermore, restrictions and rules are not a good way of teaching moderation. Practices like Saturday candy facilitate an unhealthy relationship with food, which is why it's not longer a recommendation in Finland -- I'm not sure about the other Nordics.",

It's one of the few things I miss about Iceland.the pick n mix bars can get pretty huge: https://yummy-iceland.blogspot.com/2025/06/nammidagur.htmlI remember as a kid, I'd get 100 kronur (probably about $3 USD in today's money) on Saturday morning and go to the store to buy sweets. You'd meticulously choose which items to put in the bag to make sure you got the best value for money :)",

My parents always used it as a way to regulate our candy-intake, by postponing all candy until the weekend, so i’m surprised to read the intention was sort of the opposite.I’d also note that Scandinavia is big on “hygge” and being home (unlike countries with warmer climates) and weekend snacks and sweets are an obvious way to make the experience comfy.",
