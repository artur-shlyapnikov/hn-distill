Travis Himmel looked like he was stoned in it (his acting style?) and the plain weirdness of it reminded me of old Heavy Metal comics of the seventies. The nearest I have had to that was reading the Prophet series. Themes of religion and general human weirdness https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/prophet",

    "textPlain": "The first season was excellent, and then in the 2nd season they did ruin lots of the story lines with just lame choices, and then the ending went completely downhill for me. It pissed me off, just like GoT.There was this other series called Murderbot which had some similarities in the setting of the story. It was not that great compared to the 1st season of Raised by Wolves, but it was consistent throughout the whole series (so far) in quality, and it is much more satisfying.Anyways if you like scifi and haven't checked out The Expanse yet, that is a masterpiece.",

    "textPlain": "The first season of The Expanse was great. Then it got progressively more meh with each season.(obviously my personal opinion eh?)For a really nerdy-oriented SF series try Three Body i.e. the 2023 Tencent version of The Three Body Problem. Again in my opinion the 2024 Netflix version, was one of the boringest things I've ever watched. I'm pretty sure if that had been my introduction to the Rememberance of Earth Past series I would have been left distinctly unimpressed.For an example of what I mean by \"nerdy-oriented\", avoiding spoilers there's a scene where some of the characters are observing a certain celestial phenomenon. In the Netflix series they are sitting outside looking at something that should not be visible by naked eye. In the Tencent series they're sitting in a proper scientific station, i.e. a big room lined with PC workstations and side-rooms with bigger machines and printers, and they're starting endlessly at a single red line on a monitor while munching on junk food.Another thing: a certain Chinese army base in the 1960's is decorated with picture-perfect, period hardware, big mainframes that a character is shown physically disassembling to service. In the Netflix series... honestly, I don't even remember. The attention to detail that only a proper nerd would notice is, to me, something genuinely new, like I've never see anyone go to all that trouble before to make sure a certain demographic won't scrunch up their face and go \"that's not how computers looked in the '60s\".I should also say that there is certainly quite a bit of overacting (or over-directing) in the early episodes but they get over it later.",
