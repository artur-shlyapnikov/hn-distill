    "textPlain": "Hey guys, we're building LuxPDF.com, an ongoing project to develop the most transparent PDF WebApp in the world. We just launched (so expect some bugs, UI problems etc.), and our site is currently in early-stage development. We offer over 15+ PDF Tools, all completely free, all open-sourced, all client-side, with no registration needed, no file size limits, and no batch processing limits.We built this because we're students, so we constantly used these PDF WebApps to convert, and compress PDF Files, files that contained very sensitive information like names, financial information, etc. We were so frustrated with current WebApps because they required logins, had restrictions if you were on their free plan, were closed source etc. So we built LuxPDF to try and solve the problem of bad PDF WebApps in 2025.The only source of funding we seek is just donations through BuyMeACoffee/Sponsors. All we're asking simply is, if you value what we do, we warmly welcome your support, whether it's just recommending our site to a friend or colleague, finding bugs, suggesting new features, or donating through BuyMeACoffee. Any donators/sponsors will have their names/banner and a custom message of their choice listed on the webapp, as a Thank You.",

    "textPlain": "> You agree not to use LuxPDF to process any material that is unlawful, offensive, or otherwise objectionable.So I can't take Hunie Pop images and convert them to PDF?The site says the tool is open source but I can't find a link to said source. It also doesn't indicate which open source license is being used (presumably one is). Don't forget to put .DS_Store in your .gitignore.And the site itself is like daggers in the eyes. Black text on white background. The dark mode hipsters will change their tune in their 30s.What PDF revision do you support? I figure this is based on pre-existing open source libraries which typically means 1.6, max.You should make a connector for Power Automate.",
