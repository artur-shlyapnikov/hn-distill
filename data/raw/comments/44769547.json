    "textPlain": "A lot of the purposes in education for which the use of AI would be considered \"cheating\" involve writing assignments of one sort or another, so I don't know why most of these education scenarios don't simply redirect the incentive.For example, in an English class with a lot of essay-writing assignments, the assignments could simply be worth 0% of the final mark. There would still be deadlines as usual, and they would be marked as usual, but the students would be free to do them or not as they pleased. The catch would be that the *proctored, for-credit* exams would demand that they write similar essays, which would then be graded based on the knowledge/skills the students would have been expected to gain if they'd done the assignments.Advantages:- No more issues with cheating.- Students get to manage (or learn to manage) their own time and priorities, as is expected of adults, without being whipped as much with the cane of class grades.- The advanced students who can already write clearly, concisely and convincingly (or whatever the objectives are of the writing exercises) don't have to waste time with unneeded assignments.- If students skip the assignments, learn to write on their own time using ChatGPT and friends, and can demonstrate their skills in exam conditions, then it's a win-win.This all requires that whoever is in charge of the class have clear and testable learning goals in mind -- which, alas, they all-too-often do not.",

    "textPlain": "> There are valid reasons why college students in particular might prefer that AI do their writing for them: most students are overcommitted;Tangentially: I've helped out some college students with mentoring and advice from time to time. One common theme I've noticed is that their class load virtually doesn't matter. They find ways to run out of time no matter how much free time they start with.We all like to imagine the poor, overburdened college student working 2 jobs and attending classes to make ends meet when reading statements like that. But to be completely honest, the students like that usually have their time management on point. The hardest ones to coach were the students who had no real responsibilities outside of classes, yet who found their free time slipping through their fingers no matter what they did.Among all of the other problems with easy AI cheating, I wonder how much the availability of these tools will encourage even more procrastination. Feeling like you always have the fallback option of having ChatGPT write the homework for you leaves the door open to procrastinating even longer> I asked my students to complete a baseline survey registering their agreement with several statements, including “It is unethical to use a calculator in a math class”Unless there was more to this survey, this wording seems misleading. In a college-level math class, using a calculator is a common expectation depending on the type of class and the problem. The students would probably think of their TI-89, not a magical AI calculator that could solve every freeform problem for them.",

The course was hastily rearranged to prevent the students using llms.

Nothing completely grammatically wrong just unusual or semantically off. The example I recall was \"... disproportionately affects men and women\" but there were other worse examples. You can guess where this is going.

There's a lot of retelling of \"classic\" stories (except in classical times they were probably retelling them too).

(robin hood, paradise lost (ie. the story of lucifer/the devil), queen esther, aladdin, MacBeth, ...)The not-evil-but-quite-evil mother who sees her king/husband make a child, either with another woman or sees/fears she or her child will be put aside because of the other child and ... (Hera, Snow White, Medea, biblical story of Abraham, ...)And then there's stories like Game of Thrones that are in large part a combination and integration of a lot of such stories: Circe and her children. John Snow, after being rejected, climbing up and up and up. Bran becoming king. Arya living through a sort of Herculanean heroic epic. And the kings fighting constantly.Humans are clearly still a big step up even from state-of-the-art AI, but we are not infinitely creative like we like to think we are.

    "textPlain": "Interesting report.I understand why much of the discussion about AI and university education has focused on first-year writing classes in the U.S. Some of my own first experiments with ChatGPT in December 2022 were having it write school-like essays [1].Over the past few months, I cotaught a university class in which we also had first-year students use and reflect on their use of AI in their classwork. But the context was different: the class was a seminar on science communication (how to make science engaging to children and the general public), and most of the time was spent with the students doing group projects. Also, the class was at a university in Tokyo, and we taught it in Japanese.We have just started analyzing the feedback from the students, but my impression is that they were less conflicted about the use of AI for their group work than they might have been if they had been doing their projects as individuals.Meanwhile, as the semester progressed, agentic frameworks started to mature. I spent a lot of time on my own experimenting with Claude Code and Gemini CLI. While none of the students in that class seemed to use them, it became clear to me that such higher-level cognitive tools will pose an even greater challenge to higher education than essay-writing chatbots do now.[1] https://www.gally.net/temp/202212chatgpt/defaultessay.html",

Now, there are many cases where LLMs output nonsense, but in cases where the writing logically flows, does not self-contradict in any way and avoids unnecessary repetition, “bland” and “flavorless” are good. The goal of writing is to convey information across space-time; writing that is “bland” and “flavorless” is the best way of conveying information.I can see a number of things he did in his writing to avoid being “bland” and “flavorless”, and I consider them to be examples of poor writing:He used dozens of idioms that make the text difficult for non-native speakers and unpleasant for native readers. He used a number of colloquialisms, including some that are inappropriate in professional contexts (although I will not repeat them since I refuse to write them). He used a word whose only definition is provided by Urban Dictionary and therefore is not even an official word:https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cyborgingHe also brought politics into an",

Then you turn in the book at the end of the exam. I think it's a great idea and was surprised more classes didn't work that way but I guess it's like you say: grading written assignments like this is a lot of work.",

    "textPlain": "I've gone back to university as an adult to study econometrics, already with a software background.It has been quite an adjustment, the hardest part isn't really the content, there have just been assessment tasks that are more demanding in time than cognition. I think a big part has been these are introductory subjects.You have much less agency over your schedule outside university itself than you would have when you're working as well, which has been a massive PITA having previously worked as a software engineer for quite a while. As an institution it just doesn't respect peoples time, which is fine when you're much younger and you're just coming out of school (another institution that doesn't care for your time outside of it).I think my problems have been compounded by the fact this is a undergraduate degree not a masters. There was only a masters for applied Econ in my area (which is much less data and math focused than econometrics), I've had this conversation 100 times, not looking to repeat that, trust me the moment I see an option to change to a masters in my area of interest in the city I live in, I would jump at it. But my choice to go back to uni to some extent is an as much an act of consumption as it is getting a piece of paper to saying \"you can trust this man with econ\".Anyways in these first year subjects, you'll have assessment tasks like \"make a recording of you demonstrating your understanding of <basic function in excel>, explain the value of <basic function in excel>\". They are easy subjects but they are also really time consuming so to some extent it feels degrading. I would take steps to skip the subject based on my prior experience but the focus of these subjects isn't even Excel, its just thrown in there because they anticipate you have little experience with these things and it'll be useful in later subjects when it becomes assumed knowledge.Edit: phrasing",
