Yet, despite all the rhetoric and GitHub’s superior position in the industry, they failed to capture the current AI editor market.Structurally, it also makes sense for GitHub to be part of Microsoft proper.Perhaps this is a change for the better.(PS: despite their “failure” to win hearts and minds, I do recommend giving Copilot in VSCode another look these days.
