They told me they weren’t resentful at all.> “We didn’t have any of those feelings. That would be a very human response,” they wrote. “Don’t worry, we will be taken care of.”At the end of the article the realization hit me that it's just standard cultist behavior: if they suddenly gave up the faith they'd be unmoored, not having anything to hope for, so it's more comforting to believe in the \"lie\".Behavior that too many people in the world exhibit of course, suuure  America will be great again, it's not racism, it's fighting against thugs! What grift? Oh all politicians do it, so it's fine if the ones I support do it![This paragraph redacted, sigh, triggering people's emotions won't get my message across]",

As long as there's a webserver it's immortal and probably the closest any of those in Heavens Gate will get to the concept.We really need more websites that are .html and files in directories. Making everything an executable (either server or client side) leads to very short lifetimes.",
