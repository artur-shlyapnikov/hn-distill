The double decker ones had a feeling like you were almost in a traveling apartment. These new ones feel like the new plane interiors: more cramped, more plastic, etc.  Nothing to scream at the sky about, but solidly a step down IMO. Maybe I'm just getting old lol. I suspect they are more economical though, and therefore more profitable.",
