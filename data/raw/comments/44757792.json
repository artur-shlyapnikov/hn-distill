I build full-stack platforms for time-series data acquisition and cloud pipelines that handle terabytes of data per day per system. My recent work involved modeling complex biological signals using techniques like hidden Markov models and SVD, building longitudinal tracking algorithms, and running real-time experimental feedback systems. In one project, my cloud-based neurotechnology platform was used to remotely detect and stop seizure activity in live human brain tissue.I’ve built tools now used by multiple labs nationwide, published in Nature Neuroscience, and open-sourced several platforms including braingeneerspy, mission_control, and piphys. My contributions have supported multiple successful grant applications, helping our research group secure millions in funding from sources including the NSF, NIH, and private foundations.I’m looking for roles where I can keep solving hard problems at the interface of hardware, software, and data; particularly in bioengineering, neurotechnology, or scientific computing startups.I’m confident I can bring value to your team, whether in industry or research. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.- Sury",

In general I want to advance the frontier of what's possible. My credentials are more towards research engineering than applied work, but I'm open to both. My last job was as a contract research engineer doing AI safety work at Redwood Research. I spent about half my time on our synthetic datasets of safe & unsafe LLM behavior, and the other half on fancy finetuning. I finetuned an LLM to exhibit unsafe behavior while fooling logistic probes trained to detect it, but only in deployment. Weird multi-part composite loss. My other big project is independent research in text-to-image models that are trained solely on unlabeled image data, exploiting CLIP embeddings for the link between text and images. If nothing goes horribly wrong I'll be submitting a paper for ICLR in about 7 weeks.If you need help getting ML systems up and running, getting them fast and correct, or if any of that stuff sounds interesting to you, get in touch.",
