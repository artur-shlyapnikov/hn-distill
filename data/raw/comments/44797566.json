I've come to expect this from clickbait youtube videos that try to make you watch to the end for the one bit of information you're looking for, but to see this in an article that presumably is not monetised in the same way is just weird.For the record, I would have gladly read the full article if it hadn't annoyed me so much with this attempt to make sure I read to the end, which, let's be fair, nobody is going to do unless they're a nerd with an insatiable curiosity and a manic compulsion to read every bit of text on the page; but then that's the audience this article targets anyway, so why make it annoying to read? Either you find the subject fascinating and you'll read the entire article anyway, or you don't and you won't get past the title.",

Everyone involved is deservedly proud of this one.A big part of what makes me happy is that this seems quite niche to me, but it's getting a ton of attention which suggests people care about this more than I realized. That feels good! This is a huge deal for biodiversity in a huge swath of the Pacific Ocean.",

That’s because the kelp grows so rapidly and then is sucked down into the deep sea. Ideally the ecosystem itself would somehow receive money for its services—but short of that, some foundation on behalf of the ecosystem —and short of that, some organization that’d be prepared to use the money to reinvest in other ecosystems.",

Scrolling through data on her laptop, an unmistakable pattern jumped out. Of the hundreds of microorganisms in the samples, enormous quantities of bacteria from the genus Vibrio seemed present in sick stars. The pattern was so strong, Prentice tells me, that she assumed she'd bungled the analysis.\n\nI'm not familiar with sequencing much, but would feeding these to models similar to or purpose built like AlphaFold shorten the research time drastically [0]? If not, what other recent technological advancements do you reckon that'd help here?
