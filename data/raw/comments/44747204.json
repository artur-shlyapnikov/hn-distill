    "textPlain": "Coincidentally, the IA tool of Semgrep just signalled me a real although very minor issue on some C project a couple of days ago. So I tried gecko on the same repository to see if it could detect anything else, but no. So I removed the fix from the github repo to see if gecko would also complain about the issue, but I believe I hit a bug in the UI: I deleted the previous project and created a new one, using the same github URL of course, and although gecko said that it started the scan, the list of scans stayed disapointingly empty.",

That said, I uploaded sydbox.git temporarily to gitlab to have it scanned. It took 10 minutes to scan the whole project and it found a single vulnerability \"RCE: IRC Message Command Execution Bypass\" in file dev/bot.py which is our IRC script to run commands on the CTF server. Hilarious! Please do better :)",

The academia has spent decades of effort on this. I am wondering why your custom parser could do this much better. And, I am interested in how to store dynamic typing information into Protobuf's strong typing system.Due to the limited context window, it is definitely unaffordable to provide the entire application's source code to the model. I am wondering what kind of \"context\" information is generally helpful for bug detection, like the call chain?",

I've tried a few static analysis tools for security, but it feels like the cookie cutter checks aren't that effective for catching anything but the most basic vulnerabilities. Having context on the actual purpose of the code seems like a great way to provide better scans without needing to a researcher for a deeper pentest.I just started a scan on an open source project I was looking at, but I would love to see you add Elixir to the list of supported languages so that I can use this for my team's codebase!",
