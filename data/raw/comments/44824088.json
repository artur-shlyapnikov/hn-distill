They tried recover their belongings by digging underground, and some apparently attempted to rebuild their lives in their old homes, because they had nowhere else to go.While their efforts ultimately proved to be futile, they did leave some historical artifacts behind (e.g. bread oven entirely made of salvaged materials), and the archaeologists recently unearthed them.",
