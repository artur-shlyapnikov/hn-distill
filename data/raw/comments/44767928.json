The orientation of the last edge piece is determined by the orientation of the first 11.> 3) I need to track how many swaps I create by placing those pieces. An even number of swaps is solvable, and odd number is not.Would it be equivalent to say, after placing the first 10 edge pieces, the position of the 11th is mandated, and then the orientation of the 12th is too? Or if (3) is broken might it be harder to fix than swapping the 11th and 12th?",

    "textPlain": "> There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 ways to arrange a Rubik’s cube. If I could evaluate a million arrangements per second, it would take over 1.3 million years to evaluate all arrangements. So, inspecting every individual arrangement is out.For people who like powers of 2, that's \"only\" 2^65.2That's within the realm of computability in practical timespans, if you can make the code fast and have $$$$$ to spend on compute. (modern CPU cores can do billions of operations per second, and that's not even considering GPUs)The approach presented in the article is obviously far more efficient, but I wonder if anyone's done a \"full search\" of all possible cube positions before. I don't think there's any reason to do that, but that hasn't stopped people before (see: pi calculation records).",

In the case of passwords, websites typically ask for lots of additional constraints in what a password must have leading to dramatic reductions in the brute force effort required to find a password.",
