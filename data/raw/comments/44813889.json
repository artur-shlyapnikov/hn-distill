    "textPlain": "AÂ security review was the first real eye opener for me in my Claude code use.I opened a Claude prompt in my server folder and wrote something along the lines of \"Review this codebase from a security perspective. Think deeply about the implications of the code and produce a report\". Nothing advanced, very straightforward.It was my first experiment with triggering a larger review and it was way above expectations. Found a couple of things I had missed, found some things that were on my todo list, and then I asked it to create a phased implementation plan based on that report, and then after looking over the plan too claude fixed it.",
