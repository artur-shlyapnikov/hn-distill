    "textPlain": "Over-reliance on AI tools is probably going to be seen as one of the great mistakes of this generation of engineers.I use AI to work through certain problems or help with semantics. 99% of the actual work still comes from my experience and skill.My workflow is the same workflow I've always used. Work until I get stuck, have a five minute conversation with a colleage who may be slightly drunk, extract any useful information, then attempt to integrate that while I get back to work.It's a tool to solve problems, not do work.",
