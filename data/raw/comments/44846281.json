    "textPlain": "Awesome. I remember much earlier in my career I was working on a 3D turn-by-turn navigation software, and one of my tasks was to draw the sky in the background. The more senior guy on the team said, just draw a blue rectangle during the day and a dark gray one at night and call it job done. Of course, I had to do it the hard way, so I looked up the relevant literature on sky rendering based on the environment, latitude, longitude, time of day and so on, which at the time was Preetham[1] (\"A Practical Analytic Model for Daylight\"), and built a fully realistic sky model for the software. I even added prominent stars based on a hard-coded ephemeris table. It was quite fast, too.Well, the higher ups of course hated it, they were confused as to why the horizon would get hazy, yellowish, and so on. \"Our competitors' skies are blue!\" They didn't like \"Use your eyes and look outside\" as an answer.Eventually, I was told to scrap it and just draw a blue rectangle :(All that to say, nice job on the site!1: https://courses.cs.duke.edu/cps124/fall01/resources/p91-pree...",

    "textPlain": "Very cool.  We are launching a sensor that mounts on the inside of your window and measure the sky color for a small cone of the sky and transmits this to our skylight and window fixtures inside (see innerscene.com) so they can replicate exactly the same thing indoors.  You could potentially use a computer monitor to do this, but it generally doesn't provide great light due to using RGBs instead of wide-spectrum sources.One issue with the current code is it doesn’t model clouds, haze, or smoke so the rendered sky can differ from what you see outside (numerous HN comments notice this).  You can partially correct for this by using semi-realtime satellite imaging but hard to get super accurate which is what pushed us to develop our own sensor.  There are various CCT sensors on the market already but they only measure directional+diffuse+reflected light which is typically ~7500k but the sky color goes up to 40,000k.Here is a plot showing the color of the sky as it changes during the day from real sensor readings. Each one is 30s apart, so it change change quickly.\nhttps://www.innerscene.com/built_pages/cs_specsheet/cct/cct_...A bit more info as well:\nhttps://www.innerscene.com/SpecHelp/CircadianSky/cct/cct.htm...",
