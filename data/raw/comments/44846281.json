    "textPlain": "Awesome. I remember much earlier in my career I was working on a 3D turn-by-turn navigation software, and one of my tasks was to draw the sky in the background. The more senior guy on the team said, just draw a blue rectangle during the day and a dark gray one at night and call it job done. Of course, I had to do it the hard way, so I looked up the relevant literature on sky rendering based on the environment, latitude, longitude, time of day and so on, which at the time was Preetham[1] (\"A Practical Analytic Model for Daylight\"), and built a fully realistic sky model for the software. I even added prominent stars based on a hard-coded ephemeris table. It was quite fast, too.Well, the higher ups of course hated it, they were confused as to why the horizon would get hazy, yellowish, and so on. \"Our competitors' skies are blue!\" They didn't like \"Use your eyes and look outside\" as an answer.Eventually, I was told to scrap it and just draw a blue rectangle :(All that to say, nice job on the site!1: https://courses.cs.duke.edu/cps124/fall01/resources/p91-pree...",
