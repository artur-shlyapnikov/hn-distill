    "textPlain": "thanks for your insight! i started to build this project mainly for the tts features but you can certainly just read text on it.it saves the state of having the narration on or off, so if you ever open the book again you don't hear any voice. also the reading progress and state is automatically saved to your system log files. I'm pretty sure with a few settings in the config.py file you could direct them to your server.about the monospace fonts. yes, they're not the prettiest but they're very easy to read! easier than many much more beautiful fonts. and if you're tired of reading, just switch on the tts. ;)",
