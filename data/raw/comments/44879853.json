    "textPlain": "One thing I want to point out about software is that its perpetually commoditized. Any piece of valuable software will get a free version after some amount of time.It happened to compilers, operating systems, and renderer. It's gradually happening to game engines.That's why the largest software companies are really just network effect monopolies. You only use it because other people use it or it relies on some sort of proprietary format.Many companies like Adobe, Microsoft and Google could sustain a dramatically lower headcount if they started from scratch and never went outside the confines of their network monopoly markets.From that perspective a one person unicorn is very feasible if we think about it as building a network effect monopoly.In fact a close example already exists -- Minecraft was very close to being a single person unicorn.If we have a one person unicorn, I'd imagine it'd be something more like Minecraft than someones newsletter or Google!",

    "textPlain": "It never made much sense to me.If one person can make a billion dollar company, it likely means that the product itself isn't too complex or big - unless said person has been stealth developing a product for years. But in this case, let us assume it is something founded recently, and aided with AI because, well...AI. That's the pitch right?So what moat could such a company have? If you can be one man building a billion dollar company in a very short time, hundreds, probably thousands of competitors will spawn in an instant. And everyone will be racing to the bottom to acquire customers.Ok, so maybe one of those - the most popular, will receive massive VC funding, so that they can simply outspend their competitors into market dominance. But still, that doesn't change the fundamentals: That the product is likely trivial enough to be solo-coded by a bunch of devs out there.I think it is mostly AI founders hyping up their AI products. \"Now you too can become a billionaire overnight, if you just completely integrate these AI tools into your workflow!\"My take is that as the big AI players advance, and the models become better, we'll get some sort of platform where we can just generate whatever tools we need on the spot. That will, to some extent, kill off the LLM wrapper business. In the end, why pay $10 a month for some subscription if you can get the same product directly from the company that makes the machinery. Right now this isn't the case, as they don't have any such tools - but, I'd guess that in a couple of years that is possible.",
