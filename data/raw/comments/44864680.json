We used to spend nights drinking beer and hacking some simulations from the Computer Recreations section of Scientific American.Once we wanted to simulate the dynamics of galaxies. I don'it think it was an SA article, but we did it the slow way by calculating the force on every star individually from each other star. It was excruciatingly slow and boring.Then some time later, I don't recall where I picked that up, I updated the simulation to just model the force on each star coming from the galaxy's centre of mass.I could simulate many more stars,  have galaxies collide and see them spin off with their stars scattering around.What struck me was that they looked like real galaxies we see out there.I wasn't aware of the postulations made in the 60s/70s about there being supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, but to me, this simplified simulation was kind of like a smoking gun for that... from an 80286 IBM PC AT.",
