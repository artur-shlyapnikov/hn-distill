The USB stick will boot the kernel, but then the kernel can't properly handle the USB stick after it has booted and can't see the installation media.  I suppose I should bite the bullet and burn a CD to boot from, which should fix it.",

It's the usual story with small projects: good donated hardware, and developer time (and workspace, and food, and water, and housing, and electricity supply (-:), needed.",
