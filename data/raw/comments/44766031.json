But they're not on your side, they're just peers.Eventually I think life stagnates. Working for a unicorn had its downs, but there's just something about working with people smarter than me. One thing I just hate about social media is having to explain everything. HN seems to get me, but not quite. In a top tier tech company, there would probably be 6 or so people who have done the same thing you're doing. And you can just sit around for hours debating the best way to design a table to store currencies and be paid a good sum for it. We can talk about insane things like testing in production, getting rid of feature flags, getting rid of documentation. Or just dumb things like Wordle solving algorithms. Someone will not only get it, they'd indulge you on it. But you'd need to hire some of the smartest people in a region and force them all to join the same Slack.",

There were a couple of interesting things: these days university cafeterias are quiet because everybody eats alone while looking at their phone.  A Gen-Zer complained they 2 jobs and no time to socialize.  On top of that, our third places are being ruined with hostile architecture (parks), or uncomfortable seating (Starbucks) because they want you to just do a mobile order and get out.  Seems like the Internet should at least be a good third space, its called cyberspace after all, but at least idk how to get invited to the right discords or tiny social spaces where there's community.",

Roughly, the idea was that if you can walk around your neighborhood and see different people working at their professions, the wholeness of the neighborhood increases. It comes more alive. Children imbibe a more realistic sense of what different professions involve. Professionals are connected to the world as they create. I try to keep this in mind. As our world has grown more digital, this consideration was one of the reasons I created this devlog last year: https://akkartik.name/freewheeling-apps",

Lack of connection == lack of purpose, and that makes every action more difficult.Piers Steel researches motivation and has a book called \"The Procrastination Equation\". In the book, motivation is modelled as Motivation = (Expectedness * Value) / (Impulse * Delay). In his academic papers, it's rendered as:Utilityᵢ = (Eᵢ Vᵢ) / (Γᵢ D)That is, the perceived utility of any action increases with the expectancy that one will be able to finish it, and the perceived value of the end result, and is reduced by a person's inclination to be impulsive or distracted and the end goal's distance from the present.How can any action have utility if someone has no place in the world? As a social species, our purpose is largely defined socially. When you're going solo, it's hard to get a sense of value of a given action.",

But also… no one tells you how free it feels, to pivot, to mess up, to chase ideas without anyone’s permission. It is weirdly both isolating and empowering.

I think for a lot of people what you're might be just a fun thing and not a real job, and if you talk about how hard it can be to try to work on something yourself, they might not fully appreciate it since you could just walk away from it all and get a \"real job\".Not having coworkers is tough when you just want to chill and hang out for a few minutes before getting back to work, although if you were working remote during the pandemic or are still working remote today, you probably got used to that.Have you tried co-working spaces? I know you won't necessarily be able to vibe on the work you're doing, but having random conversations with people might make the solo work a bit more bearable.Going to meetups or events with other entrepreneurs may also help.

    "textPlain": "I work remotely for  a fortune 250 company and am on a project with 50+ devs. They are all offshore and I generally work on solo assignments. I go days, sometimes weeks without talking to anyone else including my onshore director. We have a weekly 1:1 scheduled and they are cancelled every week. I generally only end up speaking to him less than 10 times over the year.Its gotten to the point where If I have get a meeting on my calendar all I feel is irritation.I lost all my real life friends 10+ years ago once I had kids and I have worked remotely for the same period of time. I can literally go weeks without talking to anyone besides my kids and wife. I don't leave the house unless its to go to the gym or to take the kids to sports. In the gym I'm just head phones on and head down. Just got back from a mini vacation with my wife to a beach resort and all everyone spoke to me about was my physique. I had nothing to respond to them with. I honestly feel like an alien sometimes.Very strange days.",

    "textPlain": "I relate very, very hard.Ironically, I solo-built an AI bookkeeper for solopreneurs all of last year on my own dime. Predictably, I ran out of money and had to go back to contracting.It was incredibly hard for me and I started to lose my mental health. It was a struggle to get any positive or negative validation, to get anyone to pay any kind of attention whatsoever. It was a great luxury for me when an investor actually said \"no,\" most blew smoke up my butt and strung me along. Even my paying users seemed to not really care one way or another.After I ran out of money and all but abandoned the project, I had an incredible stroke of good luck when an established player in my niche out of nowhere decided to incubate a new version of my app built on their platform. For a minute, I was finally getting real traction as this company's founder started promoting me across their socials: people signing up, giving feedback, folks adding me on LinkedIn, messaging me to set up partnerships.The deal eventually fell apart and everything went cold again, but for a second I saw how much easier this all is when you have social proof. It was frustrating. Nothing had changed in me or my product other than a famous person backing me. I was the exact same entrepreneur with the exact same offering, but somehow now I was worthy because someone else said so. Well, I guess that's how the world works.I want to say \"hang in there,\" but honestly for me the whole episode was the straw that broke the camel's back. After 12+ years of working for myself, I'm seriously reconsidering my life choices and whether I still want this. I'm currently focused on contracting and paying down my debt.I think that I'm coming back, slowly, to the entrepreneurial path, shorn of many of the BS narratives the tech industry tells about startups. The loneliness is very real and I feel every inch of your pain. You are not alone.If you ever want to share or reach out, feel free to shoot me an email: me@ersinakinci.com.",
