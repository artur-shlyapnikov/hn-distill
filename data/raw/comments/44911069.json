This aligned incentives to promote gun hoarding and to shit on anyone that said anything bad about the gun industry.The NRA didn’t used to be like that. It used to primarily be funded by membership dues.  Back then it supported reasonable gun safety legislation, gun control, and protecting wildlife (so there would always be sustainable sports hunting).  In the 1970s their new leader changed the NRA funding model to aline with the manufacturers, not the gun users. He kicked out the gun safety and education people and replaced them with gun conspiracy nuts.  It made the organization richer, and he certainly pocketed a lot of it. He eventually got caught with his hand in the till and served time. However by then it was too late. The US gun culture was ruined and is unfixable because the dialog is now all heat, no light.This wasn’t an accident.
