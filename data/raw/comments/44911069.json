ISO quality systems regulations / the army mandate engineers sit in a room and dream up every way the device could fail and/or harm someone. You then classify the risk of that harm, so in all cases an unintentional discharge would be \"high risk\". This does not mean the pistol has a high chance of discharging, that is a separate metric for odds of occurrence. Even if the pistol was redesigned to only have a 1 in a million chance of unintentionally discharging, the \"risk\" category would stay \"high\".",

Gun ownership is a 2nd amendment right and often needed in areas with limited population density and access to police or animal control services (try dealing with packs of feral hog like most rural communities in the American West - can't be done without .223 calibre ammo), but that doesn't mean we can't add safety and training requirements given that there is a real issue with gun smuggling that is exacerbating crime across the Americas as well as the inability to prevent and flag high risk individuals from purchasing weapons (especially via private sales).IMO, an Israeli style model would be best - Israelis are allowed to own a private weapon, but are required to get tested and recertified every year AND need to show that they have a gun locker. All weapons are also registered and cataloged, and all gun sales need to be notified and allowed by the Ministry of Public Safety.If Israel can do it, the US absolutely can as well.[0] - https://smokinggun.org/about/[1] - https://www.everytown.org/about-everytown/history/",

Either because they were offended for being called anti-gun leftists for having concern over the p320 or because Sig seemed to be ducking responsibility with some Trumpian style PR. Maybe both. I recall seeing comments like “it’s not the left, they don’t even know what a f**n sear is”",

    "textPlain": "> They also don't say which failure modes were fixed and what remained. The article links a document[0] which lists them. My reading of this is that it's not listing issues that were found in the P320, but issues that can occur in handguns in general. One of the items is \"unsafe hammer decock\", which has never been possible with the P320 because it does not have a hammer. It is listed as eliminated.The remaining medium risks are:- The user might accidentally pull the trigger by resting their finger on it when they do not intend to fire the gun- Mishandling the gun might cause a foreign object to pull the trigger- A drop or vibration might cause the gun to fire- The user might accidentally pull the trigger a second time due to motion during recoil- The user may accidentally pull the trigger while clearing a jam- A broken firing pin could lodge in the firing position, causing the gun to fire when the slide closes- The user might accidentally pull the trigger during holstering or unholstering- The sear might fail to retain the striker, causing an uncommanded discharge when chambering a round, or a second uncommanded shot after an intentional shot- Defective ammunition could rupture and injure the shooter or bystanders- Recoil can lead to repetitive motion injuries- Incorrect disassembly and reassembly can lead to a firearm which does not function correctlyTwo of these (drop/vibration, failure to retain striker) describe the current uncommanded discharge problem. Five of the issues are different ways someone with insufficient training might mishandle a gun and pull the trigger unintentionally.[0] https://smokinggun.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gov.uscour...",
