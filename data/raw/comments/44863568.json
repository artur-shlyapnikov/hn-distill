Oppression of the vulnerable should blow up underneath any who try it. Otherwise this country is going to explode.",

    "textPlain": "I had a positive experience living in two different Greystar properties from 2013 to 2018, first in Chicago and then in San Francisco. That said, my expectations for property managers/landlords are extremely low. I learned in college how predatory they are when the small landlord I had didn't refund my deposit despite us keeping the place immaculate.Tips:1.) Read the lease. You probably have to notify them early that you are not renewing, or they can automatically renew you, or charge fees for not telling them. \n2.) Never expect your deposit back. Consider putting your last month's rent into escrow until they refund your deposit. The NY Bank of Mellon offered this service at the time. \n3.) Expect neighbors to complain if you have a dog, even if they are not loud or rambunctious, so see if you qualify to get an emotional support animal prescription to negate most legal issues.\n4.) Things will break, document them in writing, use their \"buildinglink\" or whatever property management software they use today, but take screenshots and document it for your own records, including in email, so they can't delete it on you and say you didn't tell them. \n5.) Every large landlord is a financial services business trying to extract fees out of you for everything they can think of to make a profit. They are the fast food of housing. Low labor costs, low expectations, not good for you in the long term. You should try to find a home to buy at some point to avoid enriching their shareholders.",

    "textPlain": "Lawyer here -\nIt varies whether there is monetary punishment, but sure, i'd say 75% of cases at leaset there is.However, the damages are likely hard to calculate here - since it involves calculating and arguing about prevailing rental rates in a competitive market vs the actual market due to realpage, in a huge number of places.  Greystar would have argued about every single finding you made, too.Because of the novelty and complexity involved, Greystar could have tied this up for a decade arguing about that and appealing any results, i'm sure.  On top of that, Greystar would argue all they did is share data with realpage and use realpage's results, so any loss is really attributable to realpage, not to them.Greystar may also not have tons of money.  Most of their deals are debt deals.  The company is private, and while revenue is roughly known, profit isn't publicly known (AFAIK).  So it's hard to say what fine they could afford.  The DOJ knows, of course, just we don't know.Finally, being a private firm that does what they do, my guess is they would play games and other things with any real fine to avoid having to pay it (bankruptcy, et al).Overall - getting their cooperation is probably more valuable than arguing about damages for a decade  and then watching greystar play games while losing the ability to go meaningfully after RealPage.Obviously, i'm not trying to state any of this is ethically okay or that folks who were overcharged don't deserve their money back.  I'm just trying to give you a dispassionate view of some of the decision making involved and why they may have chosen what they did.Or at least, what would normally be involved. With the trump administration, who knows.",
