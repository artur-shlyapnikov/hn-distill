I really hope that this includes a functionally complete control plane so you realistically self-host.I looked Neon recently, and it appears that it's designed as a SaaS product from the outset; while it is technically possible to self-host the individual components of the architecture, it does not look trivial, in large part because the control plane is closed source (and probably extremely specific to Neon's SaaS operations).",
