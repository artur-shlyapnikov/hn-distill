    "textPlain": "I like having a sub agent for \"pre-commit fixer\" that the main agent uses before committing so it can pass pre-commit checks. I find it useful because it uses less of the main agents context.In contrast, I find the scope of the ones in this repository a little weird. The claude main agent does great with CLAUDE.md context, so does it really make sense for it to delegate different tasks to a frontend and backend agent and coordinate between the two? Especially when the additional context in the frontend agent definition is a listing of what libraries and patterns are used in the repo?",
