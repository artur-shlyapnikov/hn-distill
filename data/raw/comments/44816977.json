That amount of care isn't strictly required but it was done and my day is better for it.

On Firefox, which I have configured to block autoplay, the article opens with a blank space. No video, no fallback, no context. Just dead air.It is honestly bad practice that Chrome does not provide proper user-level control over autoplay anymore. This encourages lazy design patterns where autoplay is assumed as default behavior and accessibility or user preference gets ignored.That said, Firefox could improve too. At least show a play button, a poster frame, or something to indicate there is a video element there. Right now it just looks broken. Both browser vendors and designers need to do better.",
