    "textPlain": "Although I'm more of a functional programmer and ADT addict, I still find this language appealing. Reading the manual, it feels like a lot of correct design decision have been made, contrary to languages like C++. Most notably for me: 1) Memory allocation and reference is restricted, leading to less problems with memory management. 2) Syntax is more flexible, allowing for higher levels of abstraction.",

    "textPlain": "I am a huge protester to the \"constantly abbreviating words\" habit in coding. It may have had a place when source code space had drastic limitations, but today \"func, proc, writeln, strcpy\" are anathema to me. Also I get that a lot of these in Seed7 examples were lifted unchanged from Pascal, but that just means that I dislike those aspects of Pascal as well.I am of the camp \"use full English words\", and \"if the identifier is too long then spend the time needed to find a more concise way to say what you mean in fewer or shorter full English words\". Incidentally AI can be pretty good at brainstorming that, which is lovely.",
