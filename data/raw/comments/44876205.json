    "textPlain": ">We were unable to find evidence that the Only Connect games are in the training materials (which of course is likely to change now).I just don't think this is a credible assumption. The BBC is one of the highest-trusted sources of millions of hours online audio/visual content, all of which is accompanied by human curated & edited closed captions. All of which is trivially easy to download. The base assumptions should be that the entire BBC iPlayer corpus is inside of all the frontier model training datasets.The communities on Reddit (known to be included in all models) extensively discuss each show & question - usually creating google docs tracking the questions asked and answers given.Finally, there's the OCDB[0], which lists every question and answer on the show.While using real questions from the show, this benchmark should be assumed to be testing the model fact-recall ability, rather than its reasoning capabilities.[1]https://ocdb.cc/",

As an American, a lot of UK geography and history questions are beyond my ken, but it's well-worth your time.  Victoria Coren Mitchell is a national treasure.It's sort of exactly what I'd think LLMs would be good at.  Maybe not so much the lateral thinking—the occasional \"math(s) question but actually it's a word one\"—but rapidly assessing \"what connects these\" or \"what would continue this sequence\" is right up their alley.  The joy, of course, is trying it yourself and seeing others do the same.",

Places in general also feature very regularly, especially with missing parts.Fully solving most walls in the time limit is extremely challenging.  It's slightly easier for the home viewer on the second wall, because there are often common themes across the two walls, but of course the competitors don't get that help.",
