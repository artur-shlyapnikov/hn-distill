Then the configuration (.tmux.conf) becomes the docs.I was inspired by the \"How to Configure tmux from scratch\" post [1].I came up with my use cases:- I want to create sessions- I want to open and close windows- I want to create split panes- I want to use vim-style text select- etc.Then I made mappings for the things I care about for my workflow specifically.Before this, I would accidentally hit a keybinding while doing something else and not know how I got to that state, taking me out of flow to troubleshoot.Afterwards, only the keybindings I have defined take action.Now tmux fits like a glove. Because tmux is so stable, I haven't had to touch my config in years. It's worth the one time effort.[1] https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-configure-tmux/",

    "textPlain": "\"When I first started using tmux, I felt overwhelmed by the very poor default UI that it offers and the amount of options and shortcuts that I needed to know to operate it well and be productive. It took me several tries before I started to feel more or less comfortable with it. One of the things that stood out to me right away was how dreadful UI looked. Not only it felt uninviting, but it almost felt “gatekeepy” - if you don’t know how to use it in this configuration, then might as well forget about it.\"EPendragon elaborate on this. It seems like you understand the shell enough to use it productively and customize it to be how you like it. The screenshot this quote is talking about looks like a shell? In what way is it dreadful, and in what way do your customizations make it not dreadful?For example, it seems like a valid criticism that shells are not very discoverable and a prompt and blinking cursor can be intimidating to a noob, and that surely applies to tmux as well. But then changing the shortcuts doesn't really address that, does it?To me it seems your article is either saying, \"tmux is a pig, and here's me putting some lipstick on it,\" :) or the problems are not insurmountable, and the solutions are nice but not life-changing.It's great that you like it better now, and we're all having fun chatting around it about how we configure our tools here on the Hacker News :) But I don't see why it's \"dreadful\". It's just.. computers, no? Tmux seems no more gatekeepy than any other aspect of computers. And I say this as someone who stopped using tmux a few years ago after getting super annoyed with it.",

    "textPlain": "The article is focused on interactive use, but I would be interested to also hear from folks using tmux as a process manager / dashboard for server-type environments. I was pretty unenthused about this practice when I first encountered it, but it's grown on me as a way to quickly get a sense of state from onboard a running system without having to rely on off-board dashboard or log parsers / alert systems.In particular, I'm curious about libtmux/tmuxp and how well it works to have a more declarative bringup than just a bash script launching things into the background and then attaching tmux windows to them.And I guess the broader question of whether this approach is an evolutionary dead end— like does it just become a pile of hacks as one discovers the need for restart policies, backoffs, ordering, whatever other stuff that is built into a \"normal\" process manager like systemd or runit? If you do end up wanting to send process stdout/stderr elsewhere or do alerting, is that now annoying if those streams are \"trapped\" in tmux sessions vs being written into log files or the journal?",

A nice feature of tmux is that it is scriptable, I.e allows programmatically sending keystrokes to a specific pane. So I built this little tool \"tmux-cli\" that creates a convenient, safe wrapper (that prevents self-killing, and has built-in delays for Enter key, etc) around tmux that lets CC spawn another pane, launch a CLI script and actually interact with it. This gives CC some interesting abilities: interact with CLI scripts expecting user input; spawn another instance of CC and give it a task (like sub-agents but fully-visible); launch a CLI script with a debugger like Pdb and stepping thru it; launch UI servers and use Puppeteer MCP to check the browser.It's easy to install via uv:    uv tool install claude-code-tools\n\nhttps://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools",
