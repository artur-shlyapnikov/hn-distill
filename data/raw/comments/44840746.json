    "textPlain": "There is huge pressure to prove and scale radical alternative paradigms like memory-centric compute such as memristors, or SNNs, etc. That's why I am surprised we don't hear a lot about very large speculative investments in these directions to dramatically multiply AI compute efficiency.But one has to imagine that seeing so many huge datacenters go up and not being able to do training runs etc. is motivating a lot of researchers to try things that are really different. At least I hope so.It seems pretty short sighted that the funding numbers for memristor startups (for example) are so low so far.Anyway, assuming that within the next several years more radically different AI hardware and AI architecture paradigms pay off in efficiency gains, the current situation will change. Fully human level AI will be commoditized, and training will be well within the reach of small companies.I think we should anticipate this given the strong level of need to increase efficiency dramatically, the number of existing research programs, the amount of investment in AI overall, and the history of computation that shows numerous dramatic paradigm shifts.So anyway \"the rest of us\" I think should be banding together and making much larger bets on proving and scaling radical new AI hardware paradigms.",

    "textPlain": "Hey, I'm the author of the post.The image has been fixed, and the point I'm making is that proprietary models are almost always ahead, and this gap is widening. OS models that are nearly at the same quality are usually distilled versions of proprietary models, or somehow get training data from them. Sometimes, after massive, expensive training runs models are open sourced anyway, and at some point that becomes unsustainable.The difference between a top model and a model with a similar ELO might seem small, but the value of even a marginal increase in intelligence is extremely high--for example I only use the best coding model for coding, whatever the cost.There's also lots of evidence that large labs are only getting started. In the past year, they have secured massive amounts of compute, which is still not utilized well. I expect lots of big training runs in the future, which will shift the gap further between OS and proprietary models.The major problem for these companies is they spend hundreds of millions of dollars training a model, and then someone comes in the next day and distills something almost as good for far less money (still a VERY large sum of money.)I don't know how this will be resolved long term.",

    "textPlain": "> Followed by a picture that is more or less inscrutable.Yeah. Just to make it explicit - that chart has Deepseek r1 at ... presumably an elo of 1418 and Gemini Pro at 1463. That is comparable to the gap between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana [0]. I don't think it is reasonable to complain about that sort of performance gap in practice - it is a capable model. Looking at the spread of scores I don't immediately see why someone even needs to use something in the Top 10, presumably anything above 1363 would be good enough for business, research and personal use.None of these models have even been around that long, Deepseek was only released in January. The rate of change is massive, I expect to have access to an open source model that is better than anything on this leaderboard next year some time.[0] https://2700chess.com/",

Instead they squandered their limited resources on a Fool’s Errand, ignoring more important crises that would have far greater impacts on their immediate prosperity in the naive belief they could create a Digital God from Silicon and Electricity alone.”",
