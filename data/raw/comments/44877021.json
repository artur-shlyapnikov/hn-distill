    "textPlain": "I'm against link rot and I hate how Google doesn't maintain old projects. But this is one shutdown I 100% agree with.Having an official Google domain that anyone can hijack is dangerous, given that many people's main internet identity is GMail (aka their Google account). I know anyone can create an offshoot (goooogle.org, etc), but Google was using goo.gl too.It was easy to redirect a goo.gl to a Google login page (which is on a real Google domain), and trick people into authorizing access to their account.I consider myself savvy, and I got a pretty convincing one recently. The email looked legit, and the link was a goo.gl link that ultimately landed me on a legitimate Google login page. It didn't trick me, but it did take me a few minutes to figure out how it wasn't legit.NOTE: This article is kinda misleading. They already stopped letting people add new links in 2019. And now, they're only removing \"inactive\" links, AKA links that had no activity since 2024. If you visit a link right now, it will be kept.

    "textPlain": "I've never quite understood URL shorteners. They seem like a way of opting into link rot and sending tracking data to third parties who aren't necessary for the client-server connection.Is there a major benefit I'm missing? I could kind of see them if you have a character limit, want to hide the URL, or have to type a URL manually. But manual typing is rare, and even microblogging services are expanding character limits. Hiding the URL seems slightly sketchy, but you can achieve it without a shorter URL so maybe that's not a real benefit.Anyway, I'm actually curious about this because people seem to love them.(and this is aside from all the very valid issues and concerns people have with Google shutting down a widely used service).",
