    "textPlain": "The config is really well setup - i am using Omarchy on a second pc (main one being a mac). Some thoughts:DHH has good taste - leaving besides application choices (some of which I changed, e.g <insert_browser> instead of Chromium, no 1password), the configuration defaults all make sense (coming from a mac) - especially the key bindings.Arch Linux by itself is a bit scary and requires config to make it \"nice\" so basically Omarchy takes away all the choices and config learning / pain - this tweet is a good summary:>  I've poured in endless hours configuring Hyprland + Arch, GTK/QT theming/scaling, auxiliary apps, and more to give you a superb base that can either be taken as-is or used to keep tweaking.[1]Tiling window managers are great - I have young kids using computers for their hw and they prefered this over mac - windows. Which suprised me as personally it is a much bigger change for me after decades of regular windows/mac window management.Linux / Hyperland Pros:- I had a old pc from 2014 - which I put a minimal fresh new install of windows 10 - and it has been dog slow enough that it was waiting to be replaced. After installing Omarchy (Arch + Hyperland) it's perfectly fast and usable.Cons:\n1. Its designed to be a single user setup - the idea being u use HD encryption and login straight to the one true user. So for a shared pc its not ideal - the way its currently configured I think you need to run the omarchy bash install script for each user and also update individually for each one - not ideal for a pc shared with kids.Really interested to see where Omarchy ends up. Its also given my usability ideas for my mac.[1]: https://x.com/dhh/status/1932130355663761794",

    "textPlain": "I thought I had missed a new development here but it's still not a distro, it's a set of scripts to /configure/ a distro, just like Omakub. Which I actually prefer.Having it be \"just scripts\" leaves all of the energy and time to be spent on the itch that DHH wants to scratch instead of all the plumbing that others have solved several times already. It also removes a plethora of thresholds someone has to overcome before they get to start developing their app in Linux.I think Omakub and Omarchy are great examples of something that should be in the base repo of most distros. A package-manager installable tool that lets you completely transform the default desktop, preferences, plugins and installed apps to a specific purpose and aesthetic.Kind of a theme manager that also includes functionality.",

    "textPlain": "Ok, so I checked it out slightly more and noticed that the omarchy installation script enables the chaotix.cx repo, which contains packages automatically built from AUR. I.e. packages contributed by practically anyone. So you'll be trusting not just one unknown set of people (AUR) but a completely second one too (chaotic.cx).Omarchy enables all this silently with pacman -U --noconfirm.This is probably fine for a hobbyist, and this is what people in the Linux world generally do, but also constitutes a pretty bad supply side attack vector. Then again, not significantly worse than what things like npm/node do.On a positive note, using the concept of migrations in a tool like this is neat.",
