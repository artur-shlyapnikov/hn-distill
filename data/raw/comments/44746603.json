Hostapd.conf is the gatekeeper of one of the most important connective channels on the planet, and we collectively know so so so little of it.At least the m.2 & m-pcie cards have finally started getting somewhat better availability. It's still 90% Compex reference designs, but they're somewhat purchaseable, after years of this stuff being super hard to get ahold of.
