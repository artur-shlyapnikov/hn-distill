Until then, more leaks will be dropped. With each leak exposing a different aspect of corruption from censorship, to AI, to financial crimes.The actual contents of the \"leaks\" aren't really new - the Israeli government has been making sweeping takedown requests to Meta to suppress material related to the war in Gaza. This was already well-known - see, for instance, HRW's report on this from 2023, itself cited in this report.What makes this sensationalist is the conspiratorial thinking that follows and is embedded throughout.There's certainly something interesting and dystopian about how Meta uses machine learning to extrapolate from successful human-verified takedown requests to begin automating acceptance of takedown requests, and how this creates, as an inevitable consequence, a kind of \"censorship machine\". But this is framed (without evidence) as a kind of \"data poisoning\" conspiracy - the Israeli intelligence agencies and perhaps Meta in tandem working to deliberately ensure this censorship is automated. When, of course, even if Meta wasn't using machine learning to automate this process, the Israeli agencies would almost certainly still be issuing these sweeping requests. And, conversely, with or without the Israeli takedown requests, there's no doubt Meta would be using ML to automate the takedown process at their scale. No c",

Israel is the exception as only 1.3% of its takedown requests are actually targeted towards Israeli’s (14th most targeted country).\"For reference, 63% of Malaysia TDRs target Malaysian content, and 95% of Brazil’s TDRs target Brazilian content\"(Back to me): They are saying that Israel is doing this at a huge scale and, very unusually, almost exclusively targeting people in other countries.The leakers speculate that Israel is doing this at at scale that is poisoning Meta's ML filtering inputs, so that they are now, without direct Israeli involvement, Meta is carrying on their own censorship of other countries. Since Israel's active TDR's produced the vast bulk of recent terrorism related TDRs, the leakers think that almost all of the 38 million Facebook posts that were censored automatically by Facebook ML for terrorism reasons during the period since the Simchat Torah attacks were because of this poisoning, but here they are drawing more on inference than direct evidence.I had not realized the scale of the program here, or that they were targeting external countries like this, so I (someone reasonably familiar with Facebook's moderation) learned something from reading this.",

There's no reason not to make the entire dataset public (anonymized if you'd like but, since the content is implied to be benign, what's the harm in not?) and show some examples.The implication that, because Israel submits the most requests that they must be acting in bad faith makes sense only of all countries had an equal amount of content generated that they'd like filtered.
