    "textPlain": "It's time that prusa gets outside pressure their printers stagnated in innovation and got more expensive. They don't even have machines in the entry/starter category anymore. Why should anyone buy from you if he gets a better experience for less. Especially now that they started to abandon their own core values just have a look at their new offerings they are the opposite for what they plead here. Less open.",

Make sure you keep an eye on the filings around your expertise, it is incomparably much easier to do something now than later.\"",
