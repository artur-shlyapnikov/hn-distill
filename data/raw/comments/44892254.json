    "textPlain": "This move feels inevitable. I expect we'll come to see an all-time high in \"vibe-coded\" apps and services/products built with surface-level understanding by creators and used by people with even less technical awareness.Most developers in this new wave don't fully grasp the systems they're building, and end-users operate in total opacity. I have personally used AI to generate code scaffolds, and spend hours debugging edge cases, printing GitHub issues, and feeding API docs back into the system to stair it right enough times that I end up understanding a lot more what it is I plan on implementing as I reach a solid implementation. The average user wouldn't even know where to start with that.Google's policy isn't an overreach; more like a reaction to the coming tsunami of superficially functional but fundamentally fragile tools. This is just the first domino. Expect more platform-level interventions as poorly understood tech stacks meet real-world consequences.The era of \"move fast and break things\" is colliding with domains where broken things ruin lives. I wouldn't want any family members/close friends getting to swallow the latter pill.│└── Dey well; Be well",

You, as a dev, gotta comply with various regulations and local laws if you intend to distribute software. Sure, most software in the app stores is still unregulated, but think of medical software (HIPAA or FDA in the US, MDR in the EU) or all software dealing with personal data (GDPR in EU), gambling (most countries), AI stuff (AI Act in EU), copyright (most countries) etc.This is simply Alphabet (the company) having to comply with new regulation. In some way, this sucks for users and for devs, in other ways, it helps to protect users of (shitty) software.And if you think about it, software seems to be the only thing you can sell without thinking for one second about regulations most of the time. It's kinda odd.What's the possible harm? Malicious wallet app stealing users crypto coins for example.",
