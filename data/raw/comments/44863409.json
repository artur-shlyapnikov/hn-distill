Sometimes there's a ratchet where you can upgrade but a downgrade is a huge hassle and/or penalised.* A la carte (aka the car/dishwasher spares model): every option feels expensive and you feel like you're being nickel-and-dimed and you know the marginal cost of providing that option was small* Top-up (aka the phone minutes model): top ups are obscenely expensive and are either a punishment for being \"cheap\" (i.e. prudent) or act as a threat to push you up a tier in the first placeAdd a few special offers, points, cost sinks and lock-ins (especially where hardware is involved), rewards and all that crap here and there to muddy it up to prevent a clear comparison being made.
