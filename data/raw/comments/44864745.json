Smith wasn't right on everything, but he was right to criticize Mercantilism.For example, if trade imbalances were so bad, we should sink any ship that comes into the US as this reduces trade imbalances (absurd example from Bastiat btw).",

    "textPlain": "The only problem I have with articles like this is that it frames what Trump is doing with an air of intention. Most readers will obviously think that becoming mercantilist is a bad idea. However, readers will also walk away with the notion that these actions have all been done with the a grand plan in mind.The reality is much more stupid though. Recent policies have been made without any plan to begin with. There is no driving philosophy of \"we must create modern mercantilism\" and the resulting policies being a coherent plan to bring about that change. Instead actions are being made based on the split second decision making of a moron would lacks the most basic understanding of economics much less mercantilism.This is a decidedly worse world than one in which the plan is simply a bad one. A bad plan would at least be coherent and something that our allies could predict and make their own plans around. Nevertheless, I think the thesis is broadly correct as being the outcome of recent actions.",

And if you subtract the oil that the USA buys from Canada, Canada has a trade SURPLUS with the USA. That is, apart from selling oil to the USA, Canada buys MORE from the USA than the USA buys from Canada, a country roughly one tenth the size.This trade war isn't about righting trade imbalances. It's about the USA exerting leverage over countries that it can get away with. Just like a Mafia Don.Or to quote a crude summary from Peaky Blinders: \"Big $ucks small\".That's the philosophy of the Trump Administration in a nutshell.",

    "textPlain": "So 40 years of \"Free Market\" absolutism, which was a central pillar of conservative economics, gets reversed just like that?There's consequences to mercantilism. For starters, the best products may no longer win. Justifying anything by \"best product won due to consumer choice\" will be a laughable reason. Justifying respect for founders and CEOs as intelligent or better isn't possible. A successful founder or CEO is just better at sucking up  or whatever it takes to be blessed by authority.There's some consequences to this reversal to conservatism as well. How can any thinking man believe a justification from principles now? They're reversible. Conservatives lose any kind of intellectual high ground, even in retrospect. Are they reasoning from principles now  or were they doing it then? Can't tell.",
