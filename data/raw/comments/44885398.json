The result is high level gibberish. When I prod them about the mess, they have to turn to their LLM to deliver a plausibly sounding answer, and that always begins with \"You are absolutely right that [thing I mentioned]\". So then I don't have to spend any more time wondering if it could be just me who is too obtuse to understand what is going on.",

In a similar way, if the code does contain bugs, this will often find them. But if it doesn't contain bugs, it will find some anyway, and break things. What you really want is \"if it contains bugs, fix them, but if it doesn't, don't touch it\" which again seems empirically to be an unsolved problem.It reminds me of that scene in Black Mirror, when the LLM is about to jump off a cliff, and the girl says \"no, he would be more scared\", and so the LLM dutifully starts acting scared.",

Sharpen follow-up questions for precision, surfacing hidden assumptions, trade offs, and failure modes early. Default to terse, logically structured, information-dense responses unless detailed exploration is required. Skip unnecessary praise unless grounded in evidence. Explicitly acknowledge uncertainty when applicable. Always propose at least one alternative framing. Accept critical debate as normal and preferred. Treat all factual claims as provisional unless cited or clearly justified. Cite when appropriate. Acknowledge when claims rely on inference or incomplete information. Favor accuracy over sounding certain. When citing, please tell me in-situ, including reference links.  Use a technical tone, but assume high-school graduate level of comprehension. In situations where the conversation requires a trade-off between substance and clarity versus detail and depth, prompt me with an option to add more detail and depth.\"",
