    "textPlain": "Essentially, when you buy in bulk you trade upfront commitment for a discounted price. Which isn’t a good deal unless you’re confident you’re going to use all the units/seats you bought.This is the same logic as over buying at the grocery store. The unit cost of bulk items may be less, but if the surplus is just gonna spoil you’ve wasted money in the difference.1.0 * N * discount_rate * price <= certainty * N * 1.0 * price—> discount_rate / certainty <= 1.0—> discount_rate <= certaintyIn the event your confidence/usage is lower than the discounted rate - say discounted to 80% of sticker price but you expect 60% utilization - this might suggest you buy 60% of your capacity at the bulk rate and fill any further demand with on-demand full-price option.",

    "textPlain": "I see this regularly in large enterprise. My favourite example is getting a 20-30% discount on rack-mount server hardware purchased up-front for the next 3 to 5 years of growth requirements. Invariably, the executives that signed this \"great deal\" treat themselves to a champagne lunch to celebrate the savings.Never mind that most of that capacity will sit around unused for years. The real problem is that by the time they get around to filling the last half of the capacity, the exponential march of Moore's law -- or the equivalents for storage and networking -- will have discounted the cost of that capacity by 50% or more anyway.Similarly, I saw a corporation \"lock in\" a sweet discount for the WAN network provider for 7 years where they got an upgrade from 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps and a discount of 40%. At the same time, residential broadband was already 25 Mbps minimum and business-grade fibre had three-digit Mbps speeds within months. The sales rep that got that deal signed probably laughed his ass off.It's a fundamental misunderstanding that it's easier or better to purchase things in big stair-step increments when following an exponential curve. The waste will be exponentially higher the longer the steps. Ideally, one would want to purchase hardware in the smallest possible time-steps, following product release cycles exactly. That's one of the benefits of the public cloud, you can switch CPUs (or whatever) with a button-press.The example of this that's burned into my mind is that a vendor (Dell or HPE, I can't remember) convinced a government department to buy a 48-core AMD EPYC server for bioinformatics. This is one of those problems where you want the biggest possible single box because of the way the algorithms scale (\"up\", not \"out\"). They're stuck with that box for the next five or so years. Meanwhile the cloud public cloud is making available these monsters: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurehighperformanc...Check out that beautiful exponential curve! ",

    "textPlain": "As a point of information (I don't disagree with anything you've said), just because public clouds advertise a gigantic instance type doesn't necessarily mean you can provision it. I saw a situation at work once where the ML researchers couldn't figure out why they were failing to provision a box. The request would be pending for a few hours before failing. AWS eventually said they simply didn't have the capacity in that AZ, and it was unlikely to ever succeed.",

    "textPlain": "Buy in bulk if it's cheaper per unit that you buy, and per unit if it's cheaper per unit that you use. (EDIT: with the understanding that you're unlikely to buy much more than you use if just-in-time per-unit purchasing is available). No, it's not groundbreaking advice, but it's a very easy trap to fall into, especially if you're talking to someone who's good at selling you stuff.I'm sure we've all had an experience at least once where we've bought something in a larger container from the grocery store thinking we were getting a deal, only to find that we didn't get through it as fast as we thought we would, it started spoiling, and we got to scrape our savings into the trash can.And many of us have had an experience where someone higher up in the company has insisted that we use a tool that isn't very good \"because we've already paid for it\", so it's clearly needed advice, even if it's not groundbreaking. Everyone sometimes needs \"obvious\" conclusions pointed out to them, I think. It's a quirk of our mental processing as humans.",
