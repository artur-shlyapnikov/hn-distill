I might be at work or even on holidays when it happens, and even wireguard can’t solve this.A 'power outage' incident doesn't seem to have been mitigated. My homelab has had evolving mitigations: I cut a hole in the side of a small UPS so I could connect it to a larger (car) battery for longer uptime, which got replaced by a dedicated inverter/charger/transfer-switch attached to a big-ass AGM caravan battery (which on a couple of occasions powered through two-to-three hour power outages), and has now been replaced with these recent LiFePo4 battery power station thingies.Of course, it's only a homelab, there's nothing critically important that I'm hosting, but that's not the dang point, I want to beat most of \"the things\", and I don't like having to check that everything has rebooted properly after a minor power fluctuation (I have a few things that mount remote file stores and these mounts usually fail upon boot due to the speed at which certain devices boot up - and I've decided not to solve that yet).",

I've unfortunately been given one, and honestly I'm really unimpressed between crap firmware, no real expandability and just all of the other compromises that come with buying Aliexpress hardware. For the same money you can either pick up a used entry model Dell/HP/Lenovo server (and if they're E3/W/other entry level Xeon, they're usually not terrible on power) or get a good ATX chassis and power it with some off lease Supermicro hardware. Then you don't need to compromise on things like OOB management, hot swap bays, a real SAS card, real 10G nics, ECC ram, etc. etc. Maybe people are just afraid of doing a little bit of putting hardware together? I've seen and have systems that use the above gear that have been going for well over a decade now, with basically no hiccups, and even the old Sandy Bridge era E3 stuff both punches above probably even RPi5 and N100 and doesn't draw more than 30-40W when you don't have spinning disks in there. I'm sure if you avoid AMD and go find a newer T variant Intel chip, you can both have your cake and eat it.",

Factoring in the cost of the hardware will probably double that (over a 5 year period).It's cheaper (and easier) to use public cloud, and then use something like Cryptomator (https://cryptomator.org/) to encrypt data before uploading it. That way you get the best of both worlds, privacy without any of the sysadm tasks.Edit: I'll just add, as you grow older, you come to realize that time is a finite resource, and while money may seem like it is finite, you can always make more money.Don't spend your time hunched over servers. Spend it doing things you love with people that matter to you. Eventually those people won't be there anymore, and the memories you make with those people will matter far more to you in 20 years, than the €20/month you paid for cloud services.",

Did streaming, email and file storage for the whole family as well as my own experiments.One morning I woke up to a dead node. The DMZ service node. I found this out because my wife had no internet. It was running the NAT and email too. Some swapping of power supplies later and I found the whole thing was a complete brick. Board gone. It's 07:45 and my wife can't check her schedule and I'm still trying to get 3 kids out of the door.At that point I realised I'd fucked up by running a home lab. I didn't have the time or redundancy to have anyone rely on me.I dug the ISP's provided WiFi router out, plugged it in and configured it quickly and got her laptop and phone working on it. Her email was down but she could check calendar etc (on icloud). By the end of the day I'd moved all the family email off to fastmail and fixed everything to talk to the ISP router properly. I spent the next year cleaning up the shit that was on those servers and found out that between us we only had about 300 gig of data worth keeping which was distributed out to individual macbooks and everyone is responsible for backing their own stuff up (time machine makes this easy). Eventually email was moved to icloud as well when domains came along.I burned 7TB of crap, sold all the kit and never ran a home lab again. Then I realised I didn't have to pay for the energy, the hardware or expend the time running it. There are no total outages and no problems if there's a power failure. The backups are simple, cheap and reliable. I don't even have a NAS now - I just bought everyone some Samsung T7 shield disks.I have a huge weight off my shoulders and more free time and money.

There's no conceptual difference between setting one up at home by using consumer equipment and setting it up in a data center. You can get pretty capable equipment (Mikrotik) for less. The enterprise stuff has more configuration options, but it's doubtful that you'll use most of them.Set up backup WANs, redundant routing, DNS, power, etc is fun. Setting up redundant load balancers, backend services, databases, etc is also fun. It's not hard to do, it's just hard to get it all right. There are probably a zillion configuration parameters you can mess with, and only a few sets actually work. Unfortunately, the sets that work in your home won't be the ones that will work in production, but you could possibly run load tests etc to simulate a real environment (though simulating multiple clients from multiple endpoints is harder than you think).And of course, getting production equipment is hard. Nobody has 2 F5s lying around. And you really need at least 4 F5s, because you have redundant locations. That's a lot of cashola. And in most environments you wouldn't want some random person messing around with the production (or test) F5s. It's the same with NAS, VM servers, docker registries, etc.I suspect getting the whole end-to-end setup isn't something people experience anymore, because small companies have (or at least should have) moved to the cloud by now.",

    "textPlain": "The others' points are valid. Google Drive is rather expensive, Hetzner is cheaper and works well enough.However, it also depends on how you use that data. In my case, I'm a Sunday photographer, so I tend to wrangle multiple GB of data at a time. I usually edit my photos locally, but I sometimes will want to revisit older stuff. I can download it, but it's a PITA and s_l_o_w. Google drive file stream is terrible for this, you never know if the files are uplaoded or not. Onedrive isn't any better. I haven't tried dropbox.Hetzner has some storage box which exposes SMB but doesn't seem to enforce encryption nor IP filtering, so I'm not very comfortable with that.Also, my internet connection pretends I have 5 Gb down, 0.5 up. The down part is usually as expected (my machine only has a 1 Gb nic), but upload is sometimes very slow. Running a local NAS is much faster. It's ZFS, so backups are trivial to send to encrypted offsite storage.It also doesn't need to run 24/7, which helps with power usage (0.22 €/kWh here).> I'll just add, as you grow older, you come to realize that time is a finite resource, and while money may seem like it is finite, you can always make more money.Indeed. Waiting around for files to transfer gets old quick. I have better things to do with my time. My NAS needs a whopping five minutes of my time every now and again when a new kernel comes out.",
