(It describes the impact of the telegraph).I remember reading the book in the mid to late 2000s and it felt so \"current\" in describing events of the day e.g.- local newspapers were basically crushed by \"international news\" that arrived immediately- the rate of commerce rapidly accelerated as people could communicate instantly around the world- financial markets were impacted by the \"low latency trading\" of the day thanks to financial news being sent via telegraph.- there is even a section about lawyers debating if contracts and marriages could be signed over the telegraph (like this on in particular as this was a debate in the early ecommerce days)I was then shocked to find that it has been published in the 1990s. Really is a reminder that \"new\" technologies are often just updated versions of old technologies.0 - https://amzn.to/4frEGyC(NOTE: the link above takes you to a later edition)",

And before that came TV, radio, car, train, boat, plane, electricity, gas engine, steam engine etc as revolutions.There's nothing that suggests the economic output per person is accelerating beyond the historical 2%/year. What could be reasons? Perhaps limited electricity, compute, AI model quality, computer speed etc.So, the more analytical side of me thinks what we're experiencing is nothing extraordinary. It's just another revolution in a string of many :)Obviously, my other, the more human side gets scared and feels afraid about the meaning of life, and humanity's place in it.",

A melange of old folk music and arresting dissonance, the piece’s first performance in Paris 1913 triggered one of the most infamously violent reactions of any concert-hall audience in history. As Blom puts it bluntly, “all hell broke loose”:> “During the first two minutes the public remained quiet,' Monteux [a musician] later recalled, “then there were boos and hissing from the upper circle, soon after from the stalls. People sitting next to one another began to hit one another on the head with fists and walking sticks, or whatever else they had to hand. Soon, their anger was turned against the dancers and especially against the orchestra... Everything to hand was thrown at them, but we continued playing. The chaos was complete when members of the audience turned on one another, on anyone supporting the other side. A heavily bejewelled lady was seen slapping her neighbour before storming off, while another one spat in her detractor's face. Fights broke out everywhere and challenges to duels were issued.”There’s something about the image of a concert hall full of rich, fancy people erupting in a melee that is just delightful",
