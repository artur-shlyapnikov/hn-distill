    "textPlain": "Conversations about processed, heavily processed, and ultra-processed foods always trigger people who recognize that it’s an imperfect measure. It should be interpreted as a heuristic, not a perfect 1D measure of a food’s healthiness.As a heuristic it correlates quite well to many measures. The more someone’s diet falls on the ultra-processed end of the spectrum and the less they eat of unprocessed foods, the higher the rate of health problems.A simple example of the effects of processing would be considering an apple: Eating a whole apple is the healthiest because you consume all of the fiber and the digestion process is slowed because you have to break it down. Crushing it into something like apple sauce preserves much of the structure but now it absorbs faster and it’s easier to overeat it before your body can recognize it’s full. Processing it further to apple juice removes the fiber and now makes it spike your blood sugar and it’s easy to consume a lot of sugar.Ultra processed would take this even further, packaging it in a container with added sugar and some preservatives for shelf life. This is where it enters kids (and adults) diets, where it is far removed from the unprocessed Apple it started as.",

    "textPlain": "What really amazes me is seeing little kids at the playground etc, walking around and eating things like Cheetos. Not only is this ultra-processed junk terrible for them, it's programming them bad habits (and manners) to just free feed and roam around like that. Is it any wonder why America is so fat and unhealthy and so many struggle with eating issues? You don't see this behavior nearly as often in Europe, Asia, etc and it should come at no surprise that those kids are more mature and have better self control over American kids.",

    "textPlain": "Ultra-processed doesn't automatically mean unhealthy. It's what it's made of and how it's processed, and the quantities you ingest that can make it unhealthy, just like some unprocessed foods can still be unhealthy depending on what they are.Whole grain cereal with low sugar contents fall under ultra-processed, and it could still be more nutritious and less sugary than freshly squeezed OJ.",

Unfortunately, there’s just a lot of misinformation out there as it relates to diet (food pyramid being one of the most egregious examples). For one, although most ultra processed foods are bad, some can be actually beneficial for those with medical issues.",
