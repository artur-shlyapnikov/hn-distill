    "textPlain": "A helpful framework I’ve liked is- Palantir was incredible technology during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq for putting the proverbial warheads on foreheads of insurgents with terrible SIGINT practices and a lot of generated data. You could build and analyze graphs of insurgent networks that were tangibly powerful- After that, in my mind what was very similar tech was sold to US domestic police, corporate insider threat teams, whatever. As I recall it had uneven adoption due to expense- Now in 2025, that same tech is slated to have broad access to American citizen data under an entirely trustable and stable executive  branch.With those face value facts, a capable technical mind like those in hackernews could draw logical conclusions.To put a pin in it - threat modeling for what you say and do online as this era progresses is interesting to consider. Now with tech like  this, your threat model is now you + your friends. Who’s the “radical” in your friend group, and is the group chat on unencrypted systems? Consider what your graph would be, and how much do you trust tech like this ran by either the current team or the other team.",
