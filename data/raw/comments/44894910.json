    "textPlain": "A helpful framework I’ve liked is- Palantir was incredible technology during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq for putting the proverbial warheads on foreheads of insurgents with terrible SIGINT practices and a lot of generated data. You could build and analyze graphs of insurgent networks that were tangibly powerful- After that, in my mind what was very similar tech was sold to US domestic police, corporate insider threat teams, whatever. As I recall it had uneven adoption due to expense- Now in 2025, that same tech is slated to have broad access to American citizen data under an entirely trustable and stable executive  branch.With those face value facts, a capable technical mind like those in hackernews could draw logical conclusions.To put a pin in it - threat modeling for what you say and do online as this era progresses is interesting to consider. Now with tech like  this, your threat model is now you + your friends. Who’s the “radical” in your friend group, and is the group chat on unencrypted systems? Consider what your graph would be, and how much do you trust tech like this ran by either the current team or the other team.",

    "textPlain": "Palantir's business operations are not a secret, despite the company's latest efforts at obfuscation. In fact, there is a recent academic study about Palantir and the surveillance data industry:Sarah Brayne (2020) Predict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policing, Oxford University Presshttps://www.amazon.com/Predict-Surveil-Discretion-Future-Pol...According to the book, Palantir is one of the largest companies specializing in surveillance data management services for clients in the U.S. military, law enforcement and other corporations. Palantir does not own its data but rather provides an interface that runs on top of other data systems, including legacy systems, making it possible to link data points across separate systems. Palantir gathers its data primarily from \"data brokerage firms,\" including LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters CLEAR, Acxiom, CoreLogic, Cambridge Analytica, Datalogix, Epsilon, Accurint. As Brayne observes, these data brokerage firms \"collect and aggregate information from public records and private sources, e.g., drivers licenses, mortgages, social media, retail loyalty card purchases, professional credentials, charities’ donor lists, bankruptcies, payday lenders, warranty registrations, wireless access points at hotels and retailers, phone service providers, Google searches and maps geolocation, and other sources who sell your data to customers willing to pay for it. Yet it is difficult to fully understand the scope of the data brokerage industry: even the FTC cannot find out exactly where the data brokers get their information because brokerages cite trade secrecy as an excuse to not divulge their sources\" (pp. 24-5, 41-2).Why is this a concern for people living in a democratic society with a supposedly strong legal system that protects individual freedoms? \"Big data companies argue that their proprietary algorithms and data are trade secrets, and therefore they refuse to disclose their data, code and techniques with criminal defen",

The reason Palantir pairs up its services with consultants is that it's not that useful or sophisticated, the consultant's job is to spice it up so it seems like the data and tooling is more valuable than it actually is.It's the same model as McKinsey etc, the value add is in feeling like you're getting value out of the money you're spending and half of that is being marketed to personally by the consultant and getting glossy presentations, reports, and dashboards.",
