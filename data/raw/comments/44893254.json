That doesn't mean people can't do what they want with AI. It only means that counseling services can't offer AI as a cheaper replacement for a real person.Am I wrong? This sounds good to me.",

But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”It's not the machines themselves that are inherently tyrannical, it's the human will to dominate now supercharge by technology.LLM hallucinations aside, unregulated artificial intelligence for mental health therapy is a very slippery slope. We cannot allow, say, advertisers and brands to have access to the mind of our most vulnerables so directly.",

So whether or not a chatbot counts as mental health therapy is likely quite relevant on whether or not Illinoisans can bill insurance for it.",
