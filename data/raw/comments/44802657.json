    "textPlain": "I considered this and it's slightly awkward - the hardware isn't memory mapped so the drivers would all need to be adapted, and there's no realistic way it'd get upstream. There's also the problem that the Amiga is big endian and Linux on the Pi is little endian so even if you could memory map it you'd still need to byte swap everything. Not literally impossible, but a giant pain.",
