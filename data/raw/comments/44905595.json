I'm assuming you live somewhere that requires AC every day?The article referred to driving prices up from 2020 due to making the infrastructure stronger by as much as 30%.  Which, yeah, about 150ish of your bill.It is less clear on how much it will need to go up because of increased demand?  The prediction is 8%.  Which, again, not nothing.  But it is telling that there is more increase from infrastructure than there is generation?  I don't know that that will change?",
