I just checked it out (not to really send a card though), and I got this error after entering the message and trying to go to the next page:“Failed to save your card: TypeError: Load failed”After entering the addresses (recipient and return), the next button seemed to reload the same page. Maybe it was showing some error temporarily? I had to tap on it about three or four times to get to the next page.",

From what I can tell, you're only left with about $3.50 (~$0.90 for Lob and ~$0.50 with Stripe), unless there's some kind of upsell after completing the flow that I missed.",

    "textPlain": "Just sent one! It's a lovely idea. I think most people love getting postcards and the voice message is a nice surprise for the recipient.Two things.1) The photo upload gets stuck on loading from the landing page. I think this is due to the file size? I uploaded the same photo from the actual page where you can customize the postcard and I was given a size limit warning.2) I tried using a non-US address for both the sender and recipient. Both addresses were verified, but on the preview all of the address was omitted except the street number. This could only be a preview issue but I re-added the address in the optional section just to be safe.Edit: actually a third thing. The non-US address was recognized with the appropriate city but the country still shows United States. My order number is #2CD56A",

Might be a good option to those that would send one for birthdays but can’t do one now. Capturing their email as a reminder is a great way to sell this. Actually, this would be a great product to sell through email",

    "textPlain": "Congrats on the launch!Some honest feedback: isn't the magic of a postcard, especially a physical one, linked more to the handwritten aspect of the note, and less the voice? My old firm emphasized hand written thank you's for everything because it showed time and effort into this sort of item but I feel like that get's lost with a digital postcard + audio file link. Especially when considering going back and reading notes versus having to scan a link.Curious how you're thinking about all this.",

Yeah your margin calculations are roughly correct.This is a fun side project built for myself, that I thought others might enjoy -- so maximizing revenue hasn't been a huge part of planning.I plan to market this on traditional channels (Reddit, X, etc) and maybe test out some paid ads if the CAC is <$3.50 -- open to ideas!",

My intent was not to replace that so much as offer another way to make a physical note feel personal, while removing some of the \"burdens\" of sending traditional mail.It was also just a fun way to learn how to connect all these technologies and be able to trigger an event in the real-world from a few lines of code.Appreciate the feedback.",
