    "textPlain": "Congrats on the launch!Some honest feedback: isn't the magic of a postcard, especially a physical one, linked more to the handwritten aspect of the note, and less the voice? My old firm emphasized hand written thank you's for everything because it showed time and effort into this sort of item but I feel like that get's lost with a digital postcard + audio file link. Especially when considering going back and reading notes versus having to scan a link.Curious how you're thinking about all this.",

    "textPlain": "Thanks! I agree that handwritten notes are special. My intent was not to replace that so much as offer another way to make a physical note feel personal, while removing some of the \"burdens\" of sending traditional mail.It was also just a fun way to learn how to connect all these technologies and be able to trigger an event in the real-world from a few lines of code.Appreciate the feedback.",
