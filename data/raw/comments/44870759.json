    "textPlain": "Just sent one! It's a lovely idea. I think most people love getting postcards and the voice message is a nice surprise for the recipient.Two things.1) The photo upload gets stuck on loading from the landing page. I think this is due to the file size? I uploaded the same photo from the actual page where you can customize the postcard and I was given a size limit warning.2) I tried using a non-US address for both the sender and recipient. Both addresses were verified, but on the preview all of the address was omitted except the street number. This could only be a preview issue but I re-added the address in the optional section just to be safe.",

    "textPlain": "Congrats on the launch!Some honest feedback: isn't the magic of a postcard, especially a physical one, linked more to the handwritten aspect of the note, and less the voice? My old firm emphasized hand written thank you's for everything because it showed time and effort into this sort of item but I feel like that get's lost with a digital postcard + audio file link. Especially when considering going back and reading notes versus having to scan a link.Curious how you're thinking about all this.",

    "textPlain": "Thanks! I agree that handwritten notes are special. My intent was not to replace that so much as offer another way to make a physical note feel personal, while removing some of the \"burdens\" of sending traditional mail.It was also just a fun way to learn how to connect all these technologies and be able to trigger an event in the real-world from a few lines of code.Appreciate the feedback.",
