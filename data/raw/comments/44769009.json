    "textPlain": "TheÂ discussion of how the medium affects what you build reminds me a bit of The Beginner's Guide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginner's_Guide). If I recall, it had a bit of dialogue about how the game-creation tool made it easy to build straight, square corridors... And so the map had a lot of straight, squared corridors.I don't really remember much of that game, but for some reason that part stuck with me. It's a good bite-sized insight into creativity (to be aware that constraints, while limiting, will also guide you).",
