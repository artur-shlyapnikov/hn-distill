    "textPlain": "How well can one learn financial literacy and how to manage money when one lacks financial assets and money of any significant amount?I am not questioning that one can learn enough to pass the lessons, but often times, lessons fail to prepare for the real world.I personally consider myself to be quite keen in the areas of financial literacy compared to most people. To be honest, I owe most of what I learned to two things:1. Being addicted to Runescape in my youth back in the early 2000s. I am dead serious too. For a boring grindy point-and-click adventure, the game really had a lot of real world lessons packed in to it -- predominately to much of the game's economy depending on interactions with other players at the time.2. Some unpleasant experiences growing up, but I do not feel like those had as much as an impact as #1, oddly enough.One important point about the game is that I had stake in the game, so to speak. I put a lot of (wasted) time  and (wasted) effort into the game in order to earn more and more fake, virtual currency. However, that in-game currency, at the time, had a lot of value to me. Every decision I made with the in-game currency had to be calculated and tact. \"How do I earn enough for <x>?\" If I spend <y>, I can afford <z>, but won't have enough for <a>\" And so on.I feel like in a lesson on a platform like EconTeen might lack that \"stake\" or \"value\" that MMORPG resources or real world money has. I am not trying to say EconTeen is a subpar product or anything like that. I am just thinking about myself, once a teenager, and I know I would have learned just enough to make it through these lessons as fast possible so that I may return to my video game as fast as possible.",

Are the lessons videos? Chatbot interactions? Homework questions? How will I know if my child is learning anything?

    "textPlain": "Just a comment for institutional subscriptions: if you haven't found out already, you'll probably want to hire some sales people who have the ability to check boxes and get through district red tape. If you're doing it, make sure you keep the single classroom subscription price beneath the threshold of \"reimbursible with a receipt\" instead of \"must go through the business office\". The latter can really end up being very involved. (You'll still find reluctance to spend that way, but at least it makes trials viable.)Source: gave up on the process. It seemed the larger the bureaucracy, the lower the conversion rate.",
