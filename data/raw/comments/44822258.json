On one hand, GitHub claims that 20 million users are on Copilot, and Sundar Pichai says that over 25% of the code at Google is now written by AI. On the other hand, independent studies show that AI actually makes experienced developers slower.From the study[0]:> 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience.This study continues to get a lot of airtime on HN and elsewhere. Folks probably should be skeptical of a study with the combination of a small number of subjects with a broad claim.[0] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09089",
