It's about building a new environment that puts families, rather than employers, first, and encouraging participation in the creation and maintenance of that environment by everyone regardless of age or demographic.  The return of third places, social events, volunteerism, clubs, transit, public gatherings, stay-at-home parents, and more.And as I've seen others point out in regard to the biological procreation imperative, we as a species are wired to breed.  For all the whining from puritans about pornography, I'm of the opinion that its proliferation and normalization in fact reflects a deeply-held urge of humanity to have more time to have sex and live authentically again, whatever that may look like to the individual or family unit.  Humans clearly want sex, and families, and time off, but the current global civilizational model is work > all, and thus families have taken a backseat to GDP growth at all costs.",

(Reportedly just 20% more populous, but also visibly denser and roughly an order of magnitude larger.)Many other countries in the region, like Nigeria, are much the same way.  The population numbers don't line up with satellite imaging.Then there are obvious economic measures, etc.The unavoidable conclusion is that the numbers for Africa are maximally unreliable.

During two of my last major existential crises, for about two weeks following, I noticed a marked turn of my thoughts and feelings towards having (biological) children. Stuff like, \"If I'd had a kid at such-and-such age, how old would they be now?\", \"How would I manage if a child was suddenly in my life?\", and \"Oh god, my line stops with me panic\". For a number of reasons, I am extremely unlikely to ever have kids; it would take a change in my prospects so massive that I can't really conceive of it. For this reason, I have come to feel that there may be a common (often irrational) biological impulse to procreate.But now that I get to the bottom of my message, it occurs to me that it might be tangential, since you're talking about sex, which is related to but encompasses a far larger category of activity than just procreation. Speaking through my lgbt lens (and again, probably tangentially) this false conflation creates at least the dual issues of the incorrect ideas that sex should only be for procreation, as well as the the incorrect idea that queer people can't (or shouldn't) be parents. Here's hoping that both get nixed as we rethink the role of sex, and the importance of family, in society.Just some rambling, don't mind me.",

    "textPlain": "Expectations are part of it, but regardless of compensation or lack thereof it turns out that a lot of adults simply prefer to work outside the home instead of caring for children. Child rearing is essential, and rewarding in many ways. But it's also exhausting, repetitive, and frustrating. It's not surprising that given the choice many adults would rather spend time around other adults instead of children. In the past most societies kind of \"solved\" this inherent problem by artificially restricting women's but obviously that's not acceptable or even feasible now.",

Infant mortality rates for the first 99% of human history were so shockingly, stupefyingly high, that a woman might only expect to have about three of her children survive to adulthood (and maternal mortality rates were also so high that a woman wouldn't expect to survive more childbirths than 5 or 6).What this means is that the human population was only marginally above replacement for the majority of human history. Human population didn't explode until the medicinal revolution.",

We may see a bottleneck this century and then a gigantic population explosion next century as a result, with a world full of people with very loud \"biological clocks\" who just adore and crave babies.That is assuming this is genetically determined enough to be a target for selection. There are probably correlates that are, and I could speculate endlessly about what they are, but I also know that such speculations are likely to be wrong because these systems are complex and often counter-intuitive.One I've speculated about recently is negativity bias. It seems to me that a lot of people choosing not to have kids right now are doing so because of negativity bias, because they see the world as a terrible place as a result of their consumption of negative media. Historically negativity bias may be something that's been selected for, but this may now have flipped. Optimists may have higher fitness now while pessimists did pre-industrialization and pre-modernity. But again, speculation.",
