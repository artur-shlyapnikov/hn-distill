It's about building a new environment that puts families, rather than employers, first, and encouraging participation in the creation and maintenance of that environment by everyone regardless of age or demographic.  The return of third places, social events, volunteerism, clubs, transit, public gatherings, stay-at-home parents, and more.And as I've seen others point out in regard to the biological procreation imperative, we as a species are wired to breed.  For all the whining from puritans about pornography, I'm of the opinion that its proliferation and normalization in fact reflects a deeply-held urge of humanity to have more time to have sex and live authentically again, whatever that may look like to the individual or family unit.  Humans clearly want sex, and families, and time off, but the current global civilizational model is work > all, and thus families have taken a backseat to GDP growth at all costs.",

Fertility and total population are all wrong.The DRC is said to have 100M people, but check out satellite imaging.  There's no chance -- and I mean none -- that it actually has 100M people.  Unless 9-out-of-10 inhabitants live in the woods under tree cover, the actual population of the country is probably closer to 10M.You don't have to take my word for it.  Look for yourselves.  And take an satellite shot of Kinshasa (reported population ~19M), rotate or mirror-image it, and then ask GPT-5 to estimate its population.  Also, compare for yourself vs. a place like Shanghai.  (Reportedly just 20% more populous, but also visibly denser and roughly an order of magnitude larger.)Many other countries in the region, like Nigeria, are much the same way.  The population numbers don't line up with satellite imaging.Then there are obvious economic measures, etc.The unavoidable conclusion is that the numbers for Africa are maximally unreliable.  There are various reasons for this that we can speculate on (foreign aid dependent on population numbers, etc.), but, anyway, at least take 'em with a grain of salt.",
