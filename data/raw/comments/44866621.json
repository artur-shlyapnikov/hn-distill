You cannot simply flood your country with unrestricted migration from lower GDP per capita countries and not expect overall growth to slow down.> Yes, output per capita is the primary measure of individual welfare but...> our ability to service debt and social security obligations depends on total output.Our ability to service social obligations and debt entirely depends on GDP per capita. Whilst they are both paid on a GDP basis, they a generated as a multiplier of capita. If you have 1 million people, and add another million people (of the same distribution), social obligations are also doubled, as will debt, but both delayed. It's not that complicated.> We live in a welfare state, and this is unlikely to change anytime soon.It's about to change now, the time is up. Governments world wide are now struggling to issue bonds at reasonable rates, there are no known mechanisms to unwind. The likes of Japan, a large buyer of the foreign bond market, starting to bring down its bond purchases, indicates this.> Most immigrants worsen the fiscal position of the government.This is especially true whilst you have a system already setup making a loss, such as the UK's pension system.> Each immigrant into a rich country makes the position of poor countries harder.Every doctor, nurse, engineer, etc, that we import is one less for their original country. What do we think that does to the original country on scale? What do we think that does to their growth?> Affordable housing:Many animals will not breed, and some even miscarry, if they are not in a suitable environment. Giving birth and raising children makes the mother/family very vulnerable. It seems that for all of our sophistication, the human race is no different. What we're measuring world wide appears to be an enormous economic deficit.",

I think this is an issue only because the \"very rich\" may actually see their standard of living fall.  For the poor, it will have no real impact.Plus it is probably a good thing population will start dropping.The much larger worry should be Climate Change, a dropping population can only help Climate Change in the long run.  But right now, due to how we all live, we are heading into a whole lot of hurt due to Climate Change.  Far more \"hurt\" than the population falling.Also, worried about population dropping ?  Wait to see how fast it drops when Countries start massive wars due to dwindling resources.EDIT: want an example of the Impact of population dripping ?    Look at Europe during the Plague in the 1300s(?).  What happened was the rich had a hard time finding labor, so they had to start paying people a lot more for their work.  To me, that is the big fear, the rich may have to start paying more.",

TFR skew results in large problems if the least progressive and poorest groups systematically have much higher TFR over extended periods.None of the solutions I can think of are very appealing or even tolerable.

We are probably still in a real estate bubble.I suppose I've never expected to ever be able to retire unless I get truly wealthy. It's not something I've ever included in my life plan because I've kinda seen the writing on the wall about this since I was in my twenties.I don't think this crash in fertility is that unexpected, and it's not even all bad.

Guess what, they retired a decade ago, and yet my country has the second highest unemployment rate in EU, with a very weak job market for fresh graduates in particular. Increased efficiency & automation ate all those jobs, nobody was hired to replace many of the boomers who retired. I doubt the future will be any different.",

Capitalism is more the challenge, it's built on squeezing the aggregate working age population for profits, and that cohort is in terminal decline over the long term. Between global sovereign debt load [1] and the demand for future profits (slides 31-33 of this PDF), there will be sadness as the future has less and less humans to saddle these economic burdens on. Such are the breaks when you predicate a socioeconomic system on never ending growth, and growth is over because humans globally (for various complex and interwoven issues) are choosing to have less children or no children.[1] https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt (\"Global public debt surpasses $100 trillion in 2024.\")",
