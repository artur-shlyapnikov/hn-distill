Can an LLM recognize the context deficit and frame the right questions to ask?They can not: LLMs have no ability to understand when to stop and ask for directions. They routinely produce contradictions, fail simple tasks like counting the letters in a word etc. etc. They can not even reliably execute my \"ok modify this text in canvas\" vs \"leave canvas alone, provide suggestions in chat, apply an edit once approved\" instructions.",

    "textPlain": "I think the framing of these models are being \"intelligent\" is not the right way to go. They've gotten better at recall and association.They can recall prior reasoning from text they are trained on which allows them to handle complex tasks that have been solved before, but when working on complex, novel, or nuanced tasks there is no high quality relevant training data to recall.Intelligence has always been a fraught word to define and I don't think what LLMs do is the right attribute for defining it.I agree with a good deal of the article but because it keeps using loaded works like \"intelligent\" and \"smarter\", it has a hard time explaining what's missing.",

The ability to discriminate valuable from extraneous context will need to scale with size of available context, it will be pulling needles from haystacks that aren’t straightforward similarity. I think we will need to steer these things.",

If you place a brilliant executive into a scenario without meaningful context.... an unfamiliar board meeting where they have no idea of the company’s history, prior strategic discussions, current issues, personel dynamics...expectations..etc etc, they will struggle just as a model does surly. They may still manage something reasonably insightful, leveraging general priors, common sense, and inferential reasoning... their performance will never match their potential had they been fully informed of all context and clearly data/objectives.

    "textPlain": "Providing more context is difficult for a number of reasons. If you do it RAG style you need to know which context is relevant. LLMs are notorious for knowing that a factor is relevant if directly asked about that factor, but not bringing it up if it's implicit. In business things like people's feelings on things, historical business dealings, relevance to trending news can all be factors. If you fine tune... well... there have been articles recently about fine tuning on specific domains causing overall misalignment. The more you fine tune, the riskier.",
