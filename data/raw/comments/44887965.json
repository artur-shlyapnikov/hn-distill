    "textPlain": "I love plotter art and have dabbled a bit myself. The really fun part is how pen-on-paper is not completely reliable or a perfect line. You get a little texture if the pen skips. You can use watercolor pens that bleed. You can get crazy with something like Copic markers on Yupo paper so the whole thing stays wet and smears for minutes. It's part of the art.This bit from the article made me laugh ruefully though: \"it's as simple as buying some black paper and a white gel pen.\" You can get some beautiful effects with white ink on black paper but it is notoriously difficult to get looking good. White ink is tricky stuff. But that's part of the fun!",

Computer tools such as “krita” (open source) do an exceptional job emulating paints and brushes.  A lot of professional illustrations now days are done digitally and printed.  “Art” less so but the tablets keep getting better.https://krita.org/en/As someone who was kinda adept at making black and white prints from negatives, I kind of miss some of the old tech (making prints was a little magical).  But digital / ink jet can get you 90% of the darkroom much easier and has some serious advantages.I do applaud the effort and the fun factor here is real.
