    "textPlain": "I love plotter art and have dabbled a bit myself. The really fun part is how pen-on-paper is not completely reliable or a perfect line. You get a little texture if the pen skips. You can use watercolor pens that bleed. You can get crazy with something like Copic markers on Yupo paper so the whole thing stays wet and smears for minutes. It's part of the art.This bit from the article made me laugh ruefully though: \"it's as simple as buying some black paper and a white gel pen.\" You can get some beautiful effects with white ink on black paper but it is notoriously difficult to get looking good. White ink is tricky stuff. But that's part of the fun!",

Making plotter art is not inherently better or worse that printing, it's just a different type of art.

It's like Photoshop vs Illustrator, the don't compete as much as specialize in different things. https://andrewwulf.com if interested.",

Like yes I could have just upgraded to a nicer printer, but there is something fun about the process of getting an artwork plotted that makes it fun for me.I need to upload some of my plots to share.---On a similar note for others who want to get into this, there was a thread awhile back on \"What is the 90% activity in your favorite hobby\", for example sanding taking 90% of the time for woodworking. For pen plotting the 90-95% is the art side. Taking images, converting them into g-code either via SVG or other processes, or writing code to make generative art, that is the 90%.At the end of the day the pen plotting itself at the surface level is a projection of the effort taken to generate the art. Where it gets really exciting is the capabilities and unique aspect of the medium (like touching on white ink or watercolor) that create truly unique ways of presenting the art.--Some related subreddits:https://www.reddit.com/r/PlotterArt/https://www.reddit.com/r/PenPlotters/",

    "textPlain": "Having worked extensively on large charcoal drawings using heavy etching paper, I’ve often imagined what it would be like if a proper robotic arm could take on the task. My own process involves compressed charcoal pencils, plenty of erasers, and various grades of sandpaper, really working the surface of the paper.  And watching out not to scratch or dimple the paper.Plotters are usually limited in how they can tilt the pen, and their force-feedback capabilities are quite primitive, if present. And if you’ve ever tried sharpening a compressed charcoal pencil to a fine point, you’ll know how difficult that would be to automate.If I ever happen to find four spare years tucked away somewhere, I might just attempt to build such a system myself :/Edit: to get an idea of what is possible with this technique, see the work of Annie Murphy Robinson [1], who also hosts workshops.[1] https://anniemurphyrobinson.com/",

When used with the correct paper, it produces the same high quality prints as any professional service.Looking at the artwork on my wall, there’s two big things that set prints apart from an original artwork. 1. Computer software doesn’t capture the imperfection of a physical medium. 2. Printers can’t reproduce the texture of layered colors.",
