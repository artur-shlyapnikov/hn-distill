    "textPlain": "I have always been resolute in avoiding managed switches for home use. I figure I don't need the headaches of worrying about configuring another device in my free time when I can pay less to have simple boxes that just send packets around without complaint.I even managed to find an unmanaged 16-port 2.5GbE PoE switch so now I have 2.5Gbps and PoE at every wall jack in my house. (PoE is amazing. Get PoE if you're upgrading anything.) It's a no-name Chinese brand, but who cares? It's not like anything in this house is even trying to saturate 1GbE, much less 2.5GbE. So QoS or whatever on an internal network doesn't seem particularly useful.I guess I could try to segregate the Internet of Shit devices I have (they're already on their own WiFi SSID which is most of the battle) but I mostly fight that fight by owning as few IoS things as I can.What am I missing? Why bother with managed switches at home?",

    "textPlain": "There are a ton of features that fall under 'managed' umbrella, but for most home usecases you don't really need to manage the switches often. Once you setup WiFi SSIDs with VLAN tags, you almost never have to touch the switch. I like to separate networks with VLANs.If your WiFi doesn't have client isolation, IoT devices can still scan your network. WiFi client isolation will prevent that, having them on separate VLAN also makes sense.Another usecase is a Guest network, when friends come over. You might not want to isolate clients there and allow devices to talk to each other, but also don't interfere with your home network.If you work from home, depending on what you do, you might want to have 'office' VLAN. Or a 'Kids' VLAN, where internet turns off every night at 8pm.At this point, it may be easier to QoS and give only 10% of your internet bandwidth to Guest network, and 5% to IoT device network, etc.",
