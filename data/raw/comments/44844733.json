    "textPlain": "I have always been resolute in avoiding managed switches for home use. I figure I don't need the headaches of worrying about configuring another device in my free time when I can pay less to have simple boxes that just send packets around without complaint.I even managed to find an unmanaged 16-port 2.5GbE PoE switch so now I have 2.5Gbps and PoE at every wall jack in my house. (PoE is amazing. Get PoE if you're upgrading anything.) It's a no-name Chinese brand, but who cares? It's not like anything in this house is even trying to saturate 1GbE, much less 2.5GbE. So QoS or whatever on an internal network doesn't seem particularly useful.I guess I could try to segregate the Internet of Shit devices I have (they're already on their own WiFi SSID which is most of the battle) but I mostly fight that fight by owning as few IoS things as I can.What am I missing? Why bother with managed switches at home?",
