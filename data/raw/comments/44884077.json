Instead they just stop abruptly at the mention of the magical https. Shrug.Or another classic example is all those people who think a dumb pass-through nginx/caddy https proxy infront of their backend suddenly makes the backend secure !Coming back to this specific wording, I'm not sure what \"whole class of attacks\" they are expecting to suddenly thwart just because they are running over https ? I would suggest its a bit of a bold statement, to put it kindly.I assume they are referring to the low-hanging-fruit like MITM etc, but as everyone knows that's not really where the real security concerns are in 2025 ...",

I daresay the feature that swayed me was force “pull latest images” button on coolify (convenient way to update any app), that was weirdly not available on Dokploy.What’s missing in both, and would liked to hear from hn, is docker-native backup solutions,  for backing up select docker volumes. Currently I’m using some tricks with duplicati, but I wonder if there’s anything better.Also this is the first I’ve heard of coreOS, the author says nothing about it, though it’s in the title. I wonder why someone choose it over Debian.",

Harbormaster takes care of the pulling from git repos/updating, restarting containers, etc, as well as provides a centralised config file for what's running on a machine.

Dokku has had every single feature I could want or need, even accounting for weird edge cases. It just doesn’t have a UI.With Dokploy, on the other hand, I found the UI difficult to navigate, which would be fine if the documentation was good but it was lacking.But for many of the features their comparison claims Dokku doesn’t have, it actually does: database support, scheduled jobs, docker compose support. It has some form of monitoring. Overall Dokku has been a pretty robust solution for me and anything it might be missing, like in monitoring for instance, I can just add at the system level.To be clear, I’m not anti-Dokploy and I think the more these tools improve the better. Just wanted to share my experience in defense of Dokku. Being able to spin up your apps on a cheap VPS is incredibly empowering over having to pay 10x more for managed services like Heroku or Render.",
