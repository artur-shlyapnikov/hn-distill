    "textPlain": "This is right. People ask my how on earth I know what every one of my high school classmates is up to, when we were the last class of the millennium. Along with a number of old teachers and other randoms from years ago.I just stopped having a filter. When I think of someone, I just fire off a message. The message doesn't have any warnings on it like \"oh I know it's been a while\" or \"you might not remember me\". I write to everyone as if we are best buddies who just had lunch last week. People I've known since the age of 4, to people I've known for four days.If I see someone I know at a wedding, I just go and talk to them about whatever we have in common. Normally someone we know.I really think it's the guarded, tentative, \"you don't have to talk to me\" that turns people off. Of course people are free to not talk to me, but I don't lead with that. If you lead with that, people feel awkward, like \"is he just being polite?\". If you just pretend you are best buddies, people play along and they end up quite comfortable quite quickly.",

In my case I missed out on a decade of two of my most valued friendships (it was both halves of a couple) because of a fight that didn't really have to be a big deal.And one night a couple years ago I admitted to myself how much I missed the friendships and decided to send a text. They were really glad to reconnect. I drove 7 hours to see them. The reunion was one of the best moments of my life.",

    "textPlain": "I never had this fake sense of shame or embarrassment when it came to contacting people. Some people will keep tabs on when someone last contacted them, and hold it against them. I don't.Just last month I had lunch with middle school friends I hadn't seen in 40 years. I literally hadn't seen once since Grade 8. I friended them on Facebook years previous but didn't really have anything to chat about, but when I was in the same town as them, I pinged them and said let's go to lunch. It was absolutely amazing, once of those moments that I will remember forever. Not because anything breathtaking happened, but it was just really really nice to connect with people I hadn't seen since the beginning of my life, and meeting them all over again as adults.I still routinely have lunch with coworkers from 25 years ago. I have friends that I chat with on Whatsapp daily going back almost 50 years. I have no qualms in being the first to reach out, ever.I have a friend from college that I have been in and out of contact for 30 years, who ghosted me for no reason this past year even after I contacted her a few times. Guess what? I won't hold it against her and I will give her space. I will ping her for her birthday and see if she responds and if not, then I will just leave her alone until she contacts me. But I don't feel shame or anger or embarrassment because I got rejected, that's on her, not me.",

Anything that triggers those thoughts, triggers that pain. We are not even aware of how our thinking has been constrained. We just avoid the possibility of triggering the thought.A person constrained by such a fence is very obvious from the outside. We see the irrational rationalizations that they can't. Because our thinking isn't constrained by the pain that shapes their thinking. But it takes work to accept the pain of your own painful ideas.",

I like knowing they're there but I don't really feel the need to socialize with them or make smalltalk on a regular basis.  If there's something I want to talk about I'll reach out but only if I know the conversation won't go on for days.I don't play the stupid games \"Oh so and so hasn't reached out in forever I hate them now\" or \"weakness vs strength\" in communication.  Communication is a tool.I don't dislike having friends.  I just wish everyone stopped these stupid games and stopped acting like everything needed to be a calculated action.  We're animals who evolved to make a bunch of stupid over-thought games for ourselves that make us miserable.  If you don't want to talk to someone or don't have time, don't talk to them.  If you want to talk to them, reach out.I don't understand why I'd need some app to solve that.  I don't feel hindered approaching life this way.  I either get more of the time doing the things I care about or I get to potentially have a good conversation with someone.  Don't let some company or app's profit create more barriers in your head.",

There are systematic flaws in our modern social protocols that cause smart people to miss social cues, or be afraid of initiating them. After analyzing hundreds of these invisible barriers, I've found that the people who break them aren't socially gifted, they've just realized how to move past the social conditioning that keeps us stuck on the porch.
