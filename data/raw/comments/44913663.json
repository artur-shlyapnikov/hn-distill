    "textPlain": "This is right. People ask my how on earth I know what every one of my high school classmates is up to, when we were the last class of the millennium. Along with a number of old teachers and other randoms from years ago.I just stopped having a filter. When I think of someone, I just fire off a message. The message doesn't have any warnings on it like \"oh I know it's been a while\" or \"you might not remember me\". I write to everyone as if we are best buddies who just had lunch last week. People I've known since the age of 4, to people I've known for four days.If I see someone I know at a wedding, I just go and talk to them about whatever we have in common. Normally someone we know.I really think it's the guarded, tentative, \"you don't have to talk to me\" that turns people off. Of course people are free to not talk to me, but I don't lead with that. If you lead with that, people feel awkward, like \"is he just being polite?\". If you just pretend you are best buddies, people play along and they end up quite comfortable quite quickly.",

[1]  If they value freedom and learn that you can crash through the fence and feel just a moment of pain they will crash through the fence.[1] I did find out though,  that the fence really hurt a lot more when I was standing in a puddle with cracked rubber boots.  I imagine it hurts more if you're heavy, well grounded, and standing on four big hooves with metal shoes.",

    "textPlain": "Walking past a house recently, I watched a dog refuse to leave his porch as the owner explained that the electric fence has been broken for years.\nIt hit me, we're all trapped by fences that stopped working long ago. The mental model that being the first one to reach out to friends keeps us isolated. There are systematic flaws in our modern social protocols that cause smart people to miss social cues, or be afraid of initiating them. After analyzing hundreds of these invisible barriers, I've found that the people who break them aren't socially gifted, they've just realized how to move past the social conditioning that keeps us stuck on the porch. The electric fence has been broken for years.",

    "textPlain": "For most of us, certainly including me, a lot of those electric fences are alive and well.They are powered by thoughts associated with pain. Anything that triggers those thoughts, triggers that pain. We are not even aware of how our thinking has been constrained. We just avoid the possibility of triggering the thought.A person constrained by such a fence is very obvious from the outside. We see the irrational rationalizations that they can't. Because our thinking isn't constrained by the pain that shapes their thinking. But it takes work to accept the pain of your own painful ideas.",

    "textPlain": "You're right, we see everyone else's fences perfectly while blind to our own.Here's what helped me most, when I hit a painful thought, I try to think about it as, \"What are you protecting me from?\"Usually it's something that happened once, often years ago. Next time you feel that electric fence, just notice it. Then take one tiny step towards it (Joe Hudson talks about this as emotional fluency). The fence will beep (your emotions). You'll feel the old pain. But nothing actually happens. And slowly, slowly, you realize you're actually free.",
