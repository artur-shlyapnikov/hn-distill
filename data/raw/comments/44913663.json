Along with a number of old teachers and other randoms from years ago.I just stopped having a filter. When I think of someone, I just fire off a message. The message doesn't have any warnings on it like \"oh I know it's been a while\" or \"you might not remember me\". I write to everyone as if we are best buddies who just had lunch last week. People I've known since the age of 4, to people I've known for four days.If I see someone I know at a wedding, I just go and talk to them about whatever we have in common. Normally someone we know.I really think it's the guarded, tentative, \"you don't have to talk to me\" that turns people off. Of course people are free to not talk to me, but I don't lead with that. If you lead with that, people feel awkward, like \"is he just being polite?\". If you just pretend you are best buddies, people play along and they end up quite comfortable quite quickly.",

I don't.Just last month I had lunch with middle school friends I hadn't seen in 40 years. I literally hadn't seen once since Grade 8. I friended them on Facebook years previous but didn't really have anything to chat about, but when I was in the same town as them, I pinged them and said let's go to lunch. It was absolutely amazing, once of those moments that I will remember forever. Not because anything breathtaking happened, but it was just really really nice to connect with people I hadn't seen since the beginning of my life, and meeting them all over again as adults.I still routinely have lunch with coworkers from 25 years ago. I have friends that I chat with on Whatsapp daily going back almost 50 years. I have no qualms in being the first to reach out, ever.I have a friend from college that I have been in and out of contact for 30 years, who ghosted me for no reason this past year even after I contacted her a few times. Guess what? I won't hold it against her and I will give her space. I will ping her for her birthday and see if she responds and if not, then I will just leave her alone until she contacts me. But I don't feel shame or anger or embarrassment because I got rejected, that's on her, not me.",

There are systematic flaws in our modern social protocols that cause smart people to miss social cues, or be afraid of initiating them.

    "textPlain": "I got a used 1950's era Erector Set from a garage sale as a kid, which had diabolical plans for building the \"ERECTOR ELECTRIC THRILLER\", that used the un-plugged-in AC electric motor's coil with flashlight batteries and a crank that turned a gear to break the contact and zap pulses of electricity to the handles.Of course I built it and attached the handle to the inside door knob of my room, then tricked my brother into holding one handle then grabbing the outside doorknob, then I turned the crank, to condition him to stay out of my room!I found the instructions on page 51 here:https://www.constructiontoys.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/E...INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING\nTHE ERECTOR ELECTRIC THRILLERThis amazing little device will provide lots of\nfun for yourself and many thrills for your friends.\nThis thriiler is actually a device for giving your\nfriends a slight shock. It is absolutely harmless in\nevery respect.OPERATION OF MODELIf someone holds the handles, one in each hand, and you crank, they will get a thrilling shock. This happens because the three-volt circuit from the flashlight cells passes through the motor coils to magnetize the iron in the motor. As the crank is turned, the gear leaves the contact spring, the current flow through the coils is stopped, and the magnetism in the iron suddenly breaks down, generating a high voltage in the opposite direction to that of the battery. As the battery circuit is momentarily broken, this current cannot flow through the batteries, so it flows through the handles and then through the person holding the handles. The intensity of the shock may be changed by turning the crank fast or slow.Here are two suggestions for having fun with your Erector Electric Thriller. Have a group of boys and girls form a circle, holding hands. Each person at the end of the circle should hold one handle of the Thriller. When the crank is turned, the current will pass through everyone, but with a lower intensity. Another trick you can have a lot ",

I'm way too cheap (read: stupid) to buy an electric fence tester, so I just touch the fence. In dry shoes, it's noticeable. The one time I did it in wet sneakers, it definitely got my attention. For what it's worth, we have about the smallest fencer Tractor Supply sells (it just has to go around the chicken coop). I betcha a 50 mile fencer would just about make your hair stand up on end.",
