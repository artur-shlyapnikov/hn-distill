    "textPlain": "> Personally, though, I’ll take the second game’s refinement over any such nebulous quality. If I was coming to Dungeon Keeper cold today, this is definitely where I would start.This was my feeling, too, having no prior history with Dungeon Keeper and buying both titles on sale on GOG in the past year. DKII is definitely easier for the modern gamer to jump into. It also had some gameplay ideas that were novel and not terribly well-developed, but just fun--like being able to possess an individual grunt and suddenly have the isometric real-time strategy shift to a first-person perspective.",

    "textPlain": "I remember Dungeon Keeper was the first time I ever “hacked” something, I had a demo of Dungeon Keeper that I’d downloaded over 56K, and couldn’t afford the game at 14 or so, but by looking at the config files realized all the characters and their stats were in there, so I was able to unlock all of the units, only without their art assets! Invisible giants were walking around my dungeon doing my bidding. I was very proud of myself and spent many dozens of hours playing this demo because of this, and it probably helped lead me to becoming a software engineer eventually.",

Shame the article doesn't mention him.I spent best part of a decade at a creative coworking space literally in the room directly below the original Bullfrog offices. Met some excellent people there & got to hear a lot of stories.Here[0]'s a pre-covid pic I just found of Bullfrog's original front door mat, here acting as the backdrop to my temperamental espresso machine.Good times.[0]: https://imgur.com/a/EtuzIGf",

    "textPlain": "If Theme Hospital sounds interesting to you, the more-modern Two Point Hospital is not only essentially a remake (but for legal reasons, totally not a remake please stop asking), but perhaps one of the best remakes of a game I know of in terms of updating it while keeping the core feel of the game completely intact. If I had not been aware that it was a separate game I would have had some real spooky moments as I tried to figure out how I could so clearly remember playing a 2018 game as an undergrad in college in the late 90s. (Time tends to upgrade graphics in retrospect.) Quite a few returning designers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Point_Hospital#DevelopmentThe whacky hospital hijinks may draw you in, but at its core it is a person-flow simulator; how do you get your patients through increasingly complicated layout scenarios? Which is way more fun than it sounds. Not sure the fun lasts long enough for anyone to exceed the base scenario, though, not sure the DLC is of much value honestly.(Be sure to poke at the quality-of-life improvements that are a bit buried, such as the ability to template rooms, and copy already-existing rooms, without having to completely recreate them each time. It's worth the time to fiddle with. Also don't miss that you can create non-square rooms.)Dungeon Keeper has had several attempts at spiritual revival. None of the ones I've tried hit it but I have not tried them all. The original has the Quality without a Name that nothing else, even its sequel in my opinion, has quite managed to capture. Whether or not a modern player coming at it for the first time would agree, I don't know. Mechanically and intellectually, I agree with Peter's own assessment of the game as given in the article, but at the time the QwaN overcame the quite non-trivial mechanical issues somehow. One of the very few games my wife has clocked much time with. I think a lot of the attempts to recapture it end up having the mechanical flaws with the design but with",

The devious traps, the torture chambers where you could convert your goodly hero prisoners, the way you could backslap your imps into working a bit faster, the way you could take possession of any minion to turn the game into an FPS... all of these, plus many  more, were just genius-level design elements that made the game what it is.The 90s were a special time when it came to video games. I'm a bit saddened that we are unlikely to repeat that era. There are some great games today too, but none of them capture that same zeitgeist.",
