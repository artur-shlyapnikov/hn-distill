After a second, I realized that 250,000 USD ist basically 0.00022 % of Alphabet's (Google's?) annual net income [0].A life changing amount of money for an individual, but nothing more than a small blip on Google's charts. Of course, I'm aware of \"budgets\" and \"departments\", and that one simply does not move funds between departments. And while my mind is on the verge of \"maybe they should have paid more?\", the numbers would mean that even 10x the sum would move the percentage by one decimal. It's wild how much money big corporations have.I highly applaud the researcher for their tremendous amount of skill and dedication.[0] https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1lh0pl4/google_is_n...",
