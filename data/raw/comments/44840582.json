He remembered all the details including specific equipment and model numbers of switches. He spoke in that confident tone a lot of astronauts have but somehow still very humble and empathetic and answered so many questions.He was 70+ at the time I guess so energetic he looked 40.I honestly think this was the one time I met a \"hero\" who more than lived up to the hype.Rest in Peace Commander Lovell.",

So the odd situation resulted in which the person with more spaceflight experience was not commander.[2]Lovell has another distinction besides the whole \"survived almost certain death in space on Apollo 13\" thing: He is the only one of the three Apollo 8 crewmen to have not become a Fortune 500 CEO.
