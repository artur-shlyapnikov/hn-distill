It was only politeness that would otherwise incline me to acknowledge someone like that, so if they don't recognise me that just doesn't really apply, no need.)",

Great story but does the character really need 6+ different ways to refer to them. \"Too Like the Lightning\" and its sequels are also great but Ada Palmer suffers from same of the same desires to refer to characters in far too many different ways to keep up with. That said, I also scored poorly on the face blindness test so maybe it's a cognitive inability keep up with too many names on my part.",

I describe them to people as \"my least favorite favorite books\" since they're quite good, but infuriating to read.Brandon Sanderson is another who has started to dip into this well and it's annoying there, too. Do I really have to remember that this character is named this amongst this group of people and named another thing amongst another group of people? Often, it's never even really explicitly stated that these two characters are the same and you end up having to refer to some wiki that probably has spoilers just because you find yourself wondering \"am I supposed to know who this is?\"",
