A group of 6 or so well-built young men approached us, ...\"Hey lads, are you proud to be Scottish?\", \"Er, I suppose we would be if we were Scottish, but we're from Yorkshire ...\". This being not long after \"Trainspotting\" was released, I was half-expecting a knife to be pulled, but no \"Oh sorry lads, we're just canvasing for the Scottish independence, ... you having a good night? ...\"Nice place.",

He did run after it and get a numberplate since he was close to the box at the time.That's one thing about these, it's not that no one would ever steal them as if there's some magic in these areas that leads to zero theft. After all anyone can drive out there. They exist because there's little choice but to accept some losses since you can't staff a store selling small amounts of produce.For all the comments along the lines of \"society has gone to shit, look how nice it once was\" just remember that theft still happens and these honesty boxes were always done out of raw necessity.",

Problem is we live in an English city and it's extremely low-trust like most English cities these days.It's not even that I worry someone would steal the eggs that concerns me most, it's that a lot of people would probably think it's funny to throw them at cars or house/shop windows.I'd love to live some where where this is possible... I heard that Lee Kuan Yew on visiting England in the 50s saw an honesty box and was inspired by how civilised the English were.Not sure what's happened to us since then... You definitely couldn't do that now. We're like a completely different people. Although it's nice to see that this practise does still live on in some rural communities.Also – the honesty \"box\" in that lead picture is absolutely beautiful...",

We'd then set up a card table and a cash box at the side of the road somewhere and then go off to play for the day.  While we were gone, the kindly wives of the farmers we'd gotten the produce from would come and buy back the produce from us for whatever minimal price we'd set on it.  So as the afternoon wore on, we'd head back and excitedly collect our change and then head to the local general store to buy penny candy.We didn't know at the time that it was the wives buying the produced back.  We just thought we were amazingly successful shop keepers.",
