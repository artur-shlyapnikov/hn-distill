The cells are unprotected, but the Aliexpress listing for the power management board says specifically to use unprotected cells, as at 6A draw most protection boards don't do well (dubious). The cells are tested and mechanically protected by a thick enclosure. The only EE work I'm doing is soldering 2 high gauge wires from the holder to the board that's doing everything else.

If you put them in parallel, even a small differential between the two means that one battery will completely discharge simply trying to bring the voltage of the other up to match.  This is very different from the discharge curve from alkaline which has a nice slope and the batteries can equalize without burning up very much of their capacity.These don't look like they're matched in any way.  The connection between them doesn't like very big--I suspect a non-trivial voltage drop if one battery tries to empty into the other.If you need the power, it's much better to put them in series and use a buck converter to bring the final value where you want it.This seems more like a fundamental engineering flaw rather than a fault in the boards (although, to be fair, the creepage and clearance don't look great).",
