    "textPlain": "It was interesting to read how much of the US drugs market relies on imports. The article deals with the high value stuff. However, by volume, 90% of drugs used in the US are cheaper generics often with no US manufacturers. The US is heavily reliant on India and ultimately China for both active pharmaceutical ingredients and key starting materials. With 80% of Indian production using starting materials from China.[0]The US had no domestic production of penicillin between 2004[3] when its last plant shuttered until 2021 when a factory reopened.[1] (source 1 and 3 appear to contradict, the 2019 testimony states there was no manufacturer after 2004 whereas it sounds like the plant closed in 2020, regardless the domestic capability is extremely weak)As usual for American sources this is painted as some nefarious scheme by the evil red Chinese to destroy America by making cheaper drugs available. To add my own editorialising I think US companies are easily capable of ruining US manufacturing and focusing on screwing US patients over.[2] The average citizen should probably be glad of low cost Chinese supply, but nurturing domestic capability as per Biden is sensible.[0]: https://prosperousamerica.org/skyrocketing-pharmaceutical-im...[1]: https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/reopening-penicil...[2]: https://www.rand.org/news/press/2024/02/01/index1.html[3]: https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/RosemaryGibsonTesti...[4]: sources per https://youtu.be/hS0-ugYA-ko?si=xCNzctCGr9f2M7ct",

    "textPlain": "Those corporate taxes are only paid by small companies.The Netherland has a decades old strategy of being \"business friendly\" - if you're a huge corporate.This culminates in two things. One, The Netherlands has the most tax treaties of any country. This creates many loopholes.Two, The Netherlands Tax Authority will happily help you take advantage of those. You just have to call them up and say \"I plan to sell and lease back some IP through Swasiland, is that OK?\" and they will tell you up front whether the loophole you found is OK to use - it's called a \"ruling\" and it's binding to them. This takes away any concern your tax lawyers might have about being thrown in jail for being too creative.The basic idea is that The Netherlands would rather help a big corporate avoid paying 10% tax in another country, if it means they pay 1% in The Netherlands. Or even 0% corporate taxes and only some payroll tax for the people working at the Dutch office (job creation for tax lawyers who, as established earlier, lead a stress-free life).A while back, some executives from the Shell oil company appeared on Dutch television proudly saying \"of course we don't pay taxes! Why else would our HQ be here?\". This was a bit too rich even for the Dutch viewers, and Shell ended up moving to the UK, presumably after some of their tax rulings got a second look due to political pressure. Unilever similarly left to the UK (who were also giving out tax deals like candy after Brexit ruined their economy).Note that the author is conflating The Netherlands being a tax haven (which it is) with the location pharmaceuticals are produced.To take advantage of Dutch tax avoidance strategies, most companies focus on intellectual property; this is why your IKEA pitches has \"copyright InterIKEA systems B.V.\" printed on it. Made in some low wage country, but the license fees for its design are paid to a Dutch for-profit company owned by a non-profit(?) foundation.In other words, it's easier to produce pharmace",

If the australian company is large it will be subject to a 30% corporate tax rate. If the company paid company tax on earnings before issuing the dividend, then that dividend comes with a $(1000 / 0.7) * 0.3 = $428.57 tax credit which the shareholder can use to reduce their income tax bill.That said, in terms of the global landscape of low tax jurisdictions, Australia's corporate tax rate of 30% and highest marginal individual income tax rate of 47% make things less attractive.",
