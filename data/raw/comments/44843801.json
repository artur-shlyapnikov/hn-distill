This is highly speculative, but currently there are some realistic pointers to such a scenario.In such a case, I think we will see a move to smaller, domain specific models. I think if the first cycle of the AI age is large, general models, the second will be smaller, domain specific ones that we can run on retail machines.",

    "textPlain": "This is a highly speculative post, with conjectures presented as facts. Some things that irked me:- Cursor did not hire Anthropic's \"researchers\". It hired the guys who built Claude code (PM and dev). Who then promptly went back to Anthropic in 14 days. A researcher for Cursor need not come from Anthropic either. One high profile recruit for them was Jack Gallagher (Midjourney) who is probably one of the best at RL.- Google's deal with Windsurf is structured that way because they likely could not directly acquire, or were not confident that it would have gotten past the antitrust. A signal for that is such deal increased in last few years after FTC refused to allow any deal over $100M or so. Microsoft has done such deals too. Meta would have acquired scale ai in older times. Not sure with Openai, but they arent as scrutinized as Google for such deals. To imply that this means Google did not care about ARR is not justified. and then google licensed Windsurf's IP too.- Openai's agreements with Microsoft is more probable than they did not complete the acquisition because of negative gross margins.- Plus, the old adage about how a growing startup is worth more because of a stellar team. You strip a team away and still get 2x multiple is sure enough valuing the current ARR highly.I thought the userbase is valuable. A sale at this point made sense because they might not have been to get the money if they waited a year. Reasons laid out in the article are not why I think so.",

Microsoft was an OpenAI investor and had rights and for MS reasons, exercised them. That's what killed the deal.  google announces they're paying $2.4b to hire windsurf's ceo and 41 researchers for deepmind. not to acquire windsurf. just the humans. the same day openai walks. what a coincidence!\n\nThat isn't accurate as well. Google also licensed the Windsurf IP.My question is what happened to the $2.4B? Apparently very little of it made its way to the Windsurf employees, as #2 tweeted last week. It wasn't an acquisition although Cognition was. Cognition bought a company for $250M that just got a check for $2.4B. How exactly did this work?",

In fact they are terrified of that. Can you imagine the market shock if windsurf just went under in 1 year. How fearful all investors would be? How the whole market is gonna react? We are told that AI is basically a money printer. If you release a product for $20/month and a couple of months later other companies (with much better margins by definition) release competitor for $250 then $300 then $400 something is clearly not adding up even among the higher numbers.",

It makes sense since the FTC and DOJ directors are appointed by the government, and the government is concerned about China's advances in AI.Also, Google pulled the same move Microsoft did with Inflection AI. They hired Windsurf's CEO, its co-founder, and other key people, and licensed Windsurfs codebase without acquiring the company. It was the smartest business move they could make.So from a business and political point of view, your assumption doesn't hold up.> Openai's agreements with Microsoft is more probable than they did not complete the acquisition because of negative gross margins.This is also incorrect and the first time I've heard this reason. Executives have already told reporters that OpenAI and Microsoft have an agreement, and Microsoft doesn't want OpenAI entering the software development arena. They hold the keys to GitHub, and that's keeping everyone out for now, including Google.> Plus, the old adage about how a growing startup is worth more because of a stellar team. You strip a team away and still get 2x multiple is sure enough valuing the current ARR highly.I don't think so. Investors back people first, and in AI, the people are everything. Just look at how much Meta is willing to pay top AI researchers. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are all chasing the same talent.

    "textPlain": "The way VC investments work is that it's all very incestuous. Google, MS, etc. have lots of money in VC funded AI startups. Instead of letting them fail the hard way, they usually fail in a soft way via mergers, acquihires, etc.Mostly when you read about a big company buying a small startup, it's actually an investor bail out. The company has technically failed and the investors basically want to get rid of the failing company in a way that doesn't make them look like muppets. So there's a nice press release, an undisclosed share swap, and tada another successful exit .. of a company and technology that you will never hear from again. This is nothing new. This is what happens to most startups that don't IPO.Codium was alright a few years ago but by now it's a commodity. Amazing idea of having a little side bar in VS code with a bare bones chat UI that you could hookup to your openAI API key. They build bits and pieces of tech with some merit to it since then of course. But nothing that cannot and is not being replicated by others. Same with Cursor, windsurf and all the other niche players in this market. None of these companies has much of a moat.And at this point all the big companies have their in house built solutions: Claude Code, Google has Julius, OpenAI has codex, MS has co-pilot, AWS recently launched their own thing.
