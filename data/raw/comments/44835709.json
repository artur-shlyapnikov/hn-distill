IMs usually have the expectation that I'm going to respond to you \"soon\", which is an interruption/distraction. And they don't contain enough information so I have to start going back and forth with the other person.At least with email, most people recognize that you will respond in your own timing in the next 24-48 hours. With IM I've found that expectation out the window.Save the distraction. Send an email.",
