    "textPlain": "I moved to Germany 10 years ago and while regional and suburban train service has been great, the long distance service has been terrible, with high prices, almost no high speed service and no competition. I'm Italian and therefore I had very low expectations, but at least high speed trains in Italy run better than Germany (at least until recently, when lack of regular maintenance work ultimately made its dent into the service quality).But for many software engineer this is not a big surprise: everyone knows that accumulating tech debt and neglecting maintence will eventually bite back sooner or later.",

If the train was scheduled to start at 11:07, when the big hand clicked to 7, the train started to move.It was wonderful.BTW, the D community is all over the world. We schedule a zoom meeting each month. When we began the meetings, and the meeting started at, say, 8, the meeting organizer would say \"we need to wait a bit for the rest to join us\". I put my foot down and said when the meeting is scheduled for 8, it starts at exactly 8.And everyone shows up on time! It's amazing how that works.",

But they're not as bad as the long-distance trains.One big recent improvement is the Germany ticket, for 58 EUR per month you can take any regional train or bus.",
