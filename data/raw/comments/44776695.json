    "textPlain": "There's an interesting talk about AFD.sys here too: https://av.tib.eu/media/32819The real-but-unofficial name is Another Fucking Driver. I see a lot of comments online of people saying they used to work at Microsoft or heard from a friend that works there explaining how it got this name, but I 100% remember watching a Microsoft Build conference (maybe ~10 years ago?) where the person who wrote it said on stage that he really did call it that, but they had to name it Auxiliary Function Driver for obvious reasons.Sadly I can't find that talk anywhere on the internet, but it definitely happened.",

    "textPlain": "fun fact (or not so fun): incidentally, AFD (or more precisely written AfD) is also the name of a radical far-right party in Germany. The party has progressively shifted to the fringe and is now classified as \"confirmed right-wing extremist\" by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Verfassungsschutz), Germany's main domestic intelligence agency. Ref:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_the_Protect...It's interesting to see which prominent figures of tech and politics in the USA have publicly associated with the AfD.",
