Every single time it’s been largely hoovered up by Big Telecoms, failed to expand broadband/improve speeds/lower prices, and basically just gone right to their bottom line as a subsidy.The solution all along has been funding municipal broadband as the baseline for private enterprise to compete against and surpass, but lobbyists have all but killed that dead up until the past ten years or so. You can’t treat broadband as a utility in legal language but not in practice, yet the USA seems perfectly fine with their status quo leaving them a laughing stock of the developed world.",

We just don’t have any killer applications that need more than 20Mbps. 4K streaming on Netflix, to pick one salient example, only requires 16Mbps. At 100Mbps you can download a 50GB game in just 80 minutes. Sure, it would be nice to have 1Gbps and download the game in 8 minutes, but the definition is about _minimum requirements_, not things that are _nice to have_.As such the definition we have is actually a good one! If every American had broadband according to this definition we will have actually made real progress. Nobody would be stuck on DSL any more, let alone dialup.The FCC is still giving grants to anyone who is installing actual broadband in unserved areas, which means anyone installing cable or fiber in areas that don’t have them. It’s just not requiring that every customer have 1Gbps service in order to qualify.",

The ideal situation is a wholesale countervailing takeover of power that destroys the broken congress and courts, replaces them with a genuinely responsive government, conducts a large-scale seizure of the assets of the entities and individuals who have profited from this debacle, throws many of them in jail for decades if not life, and then begins to use those assets to rebuild things on a more equitable footing.  Now that's less likely than the scenario described in the quote, but the scenario described in the quote is far from \"ideal\".",

So long as someone is making incremental progress in an area that would make 100/20Mbps internet available to you at some price, you will now count as covered- Other proposed changes around mobile speeds and school broadband I haven't been following.Incidentally, even the 100/20Mbps definition seems at least potentially in danger, as the proposal is requesting comment on whether that's actually the definition they should be using in the future.[1] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-413059A1.pdf",
