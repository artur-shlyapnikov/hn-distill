    "textPlain": "FWIW my experiences with MathAcademy roughly overlap OP’s: it’s really hard work and adult life seriously interferes with making speedy progress (notice their own success stories are with teenagers who can devote hours upon hours on racing through the - very good - curriculum).They say 1 point is equivalent to 1 minute of work and that you should earn at least 45 points a day. Well, for me 1 point is nowhere near 1 minute of work: I’m sloppy and sometimes downright stupid so it’s 1,5 minutes at best and often much, much more.Banging your head against a wall every day for more than an hour (sometimes much more) just to get to what they consider to be the minimum of 45 points is no fun, and probably even counterproductive. I managed to keep it up for four months and made reasonable progress during that time (on getting back to where I was at the end of High School, 30 years ago) but it also burnt me out. I’ve now scaled it back to 30 minutes (not points!) a day. As a result my progress is now glacial.Also, they’re very much of the “just do lots of problems and you’ll learn mathematic concepts and principles by osmosis” school of math instruction. For me I had to buy a textbook to get some extra explanation.The good thing is that the problems seem well thought out and the spaced repetition system definitely works (for me, anyway).I’m going to keep it up, because I have enough disposable income to afford it (though it is much too expensive for what it is) and I really want to bring my math skills up to a level where I can follow along the math in ML papers (and also because math, it turns out, is kind of elegant and interesting). I could go the self-study route, but then I’d have to spend time and effort guiding myself and figuring out what it is I needed to work on. If nothing else, MathAcademy is good at taking care of this for you so you can focus on the math itself.",

I went with their “world of Math” which was a feature to go over all math problems “in order”. When stuck you could view the associated video.I don’t think they have that feature anymore.As khan Academy goes from preschool through high school, you start out by counting pictures of elephants and other exercises meant for young children to get comfortable with numbers, which was definitely too early a place to start.I thought it was fun to see how such exercises looked and I didn’t really now how far I wanted to skip so I just powered through.I think it was really good with the above caveat. My other two cents are: going from way too easy problems to problems you actually have to work on is jarring in terms of pacing. All in all I enjoyed it.It’s love to know how it compares to MathAcademy. I think Khan Academy is of really high quality and to go from free to $50/month requires a lot of added value.",

Previous experience was self-teaching linear algebra, which I needed for cryptography work, and I managed well enough to help my daughter cruise through a proofs-heavy linear algebra course at UIUC; I'd have aced it if I took it. I started doing MathAcademy for two reasons: to replace an NYT crossword habit with something more rewarding, and because I have (had) no calculus. I do about 250 points per week.Math Academy is --- so far --- probably one of the better dollars-for-skills trades I've made in my adult life, easily outstripping every book I've ever bought.I have a lot of gripes!* The gamification is really annoying as an adult learner. There are lots of little cues in the system to keep moving forward, which pushes me past what feels like the limits of retention. There is no credential Math Academy can give me that I give a shit about, so moving faster for the sake of it is a bad trade for me.* Along similar lines, I really wish it was easier to get more explicit review. Part of the premise of Math Academy is that the spaced repetition comes in large part from units that build on each other; you're making relentless forward progress with reviews baked into new material. I've at times had to have o4-mini make me problem sets, which seems dumb since I'm paying for exactly that from Math Academy.* \"Foundations\", the adult learning series, is premised as being a curriculum stripped of stuff high school students learn solely because they'll be tested on it. They could strip it more. I got that sense in Foundations II but wasn't confident enough to call it out; now I'm doing linear algebra stuff and, I mean --- I object on moral grounds to inverting a matrix with determinants!The flip side though: I have a decent grip on calc now, after just a couple months of doing this rather than crosswords. My trig, another weak spot, is annoyingly better (also I now know I authentically hate trig). The gripes are just gripes; my overall",
