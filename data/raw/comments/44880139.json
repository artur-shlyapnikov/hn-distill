    "textPlain": "If you need to get into math and are not really motivated I can recommend 3blue1Brown by Grant\nSanderson (https://www.3blue1brown.com/). The best part is not only, that he explains math problems in an easy way, but also show how to approach math problems in general. I think it’s one of the best sources to start with Math.",

    "textPlain": "$49 seems a surprisingly high amount for something aimed at students and learners - I appreciate the content may be good, but it's effectively 3 times a Netflix subscription.It's meant to be something you stick with in the \"long term\" by its nature, and yet an annual subscription is $500 - this is just completely unrealistic for any student.  Someone in a lower end job hoping to \"up skill\" is going to really struggle with this.",

These are the ones I used:Precalculus by AxlerCalculus (Ninth Edition) by ThomasLinear Algebra by LayHow To Prove It by VellemanUnderstanding Analysis by Abbott <--- I'm currently hereMuch, much, much cheaper than paying $50/month. What I've spent most on so far has been printer paper and fountain pen ink because I do exercises by hand instead of using a tablet/iPad but in total this expense has been waaaaay under $50.",

At this rate I would have thought that we are able to smell the crap as consumers, but there seems to be enough people who are willing to experiment with that.For those who really want to  \"learn math\" as autodidacts, nothing comes close to the Open University textbooks that are freely available in your libraries and also with some clever searching online. That material is refined over decades to support the autodidact use case.",

MU123 -> MST124 -> MST125 -> M208 -> MST224. Diversion of M140 if you want stats. They are written by actual professionals, the course is accredited and if you like it you can turn that into an actual qualification as well. All the textbooks are in-house written over the space of over 40 years (!) and designed for self-learning.The whole set is on github somewhere as well if I remember - search for it.",
