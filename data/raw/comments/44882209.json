    "textPlain": "TargetingÂ 3.5 is smart. So much storage potential and can  still handle 2.5 and ssd. However, I want to note that initial spin up is a high current load so the board parts and tracks need to be rated for more amps than runtime (not a hw engineer, this is what somebody associated with zima has led me to believe in a related context). So if you provide more than one path of power, make sure all paths to power the device have current limitations which suit the resiliency of the build. (Zima depends on usb c current limiting, the 12v DCin bypass it unfortunately)",
