That is not something you can do in a garage(just the PCI-DSS aspect is an astronomically hard to implement on its own and that is just a tiny pert of the whole thing, merely a set of rules and behaviors to enforce).Heck, not even if you have millions in investment is this close to possible as there are so many things involved and insane amount of red tape that nowadays it is 10x harder than a decade ago and the cost of entry just keeps going up like with everything else related to online business.But PPs are irrelevant. They are merely middlemen for the card companies so they can play neutral when in reality they are pushing their policies through PPs onto the customers. They just use PPs to shield themselves from the consequences of breaking the law by overstepping their legal boundaries.I have been a strong critic of payment cards, payment processors and online payments for ages. This entire system is rotten to the core and I will dance on the grave of VISA and MasterCard when that day comes. Unfortunately, the banking industry is the most backwards, primitive , barely working sector in the entire market. They still live in the 1990s.I am no fan of crypto as today it is being used as store of value(which it is not) instead of mechanism to transfer value(which it is). Once we finally move into the right direction, I know I'll have a good day.PS: thanks to instant SEPA payments in EU, we no longer need  payment cards to make online payments. But the shift in customer behavior will take time. But in the end, that is all that card companies provide - just a different interface for making a bank transfer. In today's digital world, that is no more complicated than making a phone call, yet we act like card payments are something special.",

Depending on what the speaker means by \"Payment Processor\", they may be suggesting making your own bank, or somehow convincing a bank to let Itch shove payments through them; who will eventually do the exact same thing as what happened here. There's no winning play there.PCI-DSS compliance wasn't even mentioned and it is easily able to overwhelm organizations like Valve and Itch on its own. The hardest part of payment processing is the network. Connecting the acquirers to the issuers in such a way that everyone is happy with the arrangement. Just like the hardest part of the power grid is the transmission infrastructure. The endpoints are far more trivial to replace. If you want to use the existing network, you have to play by all of the rules. The only real way out of this system is to use a completely different kind of currency.",

Putting aside the speculative mania, the payment processor problem is one of the main problems private cryptocurrencies solve.Stablecoins are not without issues, but they've largely solved the problem of price volatility. Objections around issuance and backing might be raised, but this is more interesting for trading and less relevant for merchant transactions.Yes, there are no chargebacks with cryptocurrencies. This is an advantage for the merchant. Before anyone goes off the deep end here, let's recall the context of the discussion: one time payments to reputable merchants for trivial amounts. Game purchases do not require life changing amounts of currency to change hands. Steam and Itch are well known brands.So what is left to object to? My impression is that there is excessive cultural and political baggage.From the article:>Capitalism sucks. The economic ecosystem sucks. People unrelated to transactions in any way except \"They have the tech to facilitate them\" deciding that entire industries don't get to make money and feed their staff because \"It's risky to handle these payments\" suck.
