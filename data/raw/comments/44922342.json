It can be dampened a bit by changing themes but ultimately fixing it would mean fairly major changes to almost everything, at which point you gotta start wondering if you wouldn’t be better off building your own thing.While nether is perfect I feel that both Cinnamon and XCFE get these things a lot closer to right on average.",

I first used it in 2005, it was my first DE.They've been doing the same thing since before many here were even born.Look at this image:https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/08/17553423...The content has a bigger right margin than the left margin. It's probably a 5 minute change but nobody developing cares enough to do it. There aren't enough volunteers with an eye for this stuff, and the ones that are there probably can't override other developers that don't care.At this point I guess we just have to accept it as part of its charm :-)Edit 1: regarding the UI font choices, are there some good articles/books about this?Edit 2: A similar story with KDE on Windows. KDE 4, based on Qt 4, was supposed the \"Windows take over release\". We're 16 years after the fact and there aren't enough developers to make this a reality. In fact, I think even the basic port from back in the day has been abandoned.",

    "textPlain": "Well, the point of custom icon themes is, you know, customize an icon theme.That being said, it's expected the default icon theme does little to nothing about customizing a third party icon. When I was involved (briefly) with the KDE VDG back when 5 was about to be launched I proposed a icon style that looked completely different of what Breeze looks right now - maybe something in between of what Oxygen looks like and Breeze looks like. But Jens Reutenberg told me it couldn't go in that direction since they needed to ship certain icons \"as-is\", like the Firefox one, so it was better to do something that could fit anything so those \"special\" icons wouldn't look out of place.Some people like to diss on flat/minimalism styles but for some situations there is a reason they look that way.",
