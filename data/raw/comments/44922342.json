    "textPlain": "Well, the point of custom icon themes is, you know, customize an icon theme.That being said, it's expected the default icon theme does little to nothing about customizing a third party icon. When I was involved (briefly) with the KDE VDG back when 5 was about to be launched I proposed a icon style that looked completely different of what Breeze looks right now - maybe something in between of what Oxygen looks like and Breeze looks like. But Jens Reutenberg told me it couldn't go in that direction since they needed to ship certain icons \"as-is\", like the Firefox one, so it was better to do something that could fit anything so those \"special\" icons wouldn't look out of place.Some people like to diss on flat/minimalism styles but for some situations there is a reason they look that way.",
