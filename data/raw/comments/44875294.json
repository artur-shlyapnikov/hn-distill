    "textPlain": "Notice how the top stocks suddenly began making insane profit growth after march of 2023? GPT-4, arguably the biggest leap in AI actualization, released on March 14th, 2023. I assume that is when these largest companies (Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google) started gaining crazy investment for data/AI/processing hardware.I see it as an inflation of speculative worth of these companies. The value they are providing can in no way be proportional to the rate of growth of their stock. It is just a circulation of their own money being passed through each of those companies' services, and not anything of worth to the consumer.",

    "textPlain": "This is the expected outcome in capitalism. The general flow is money -> commodities -> greater money, and while it's not zero sum eventually that flow necessarily concentrates the money into entities that have the most money.Once you become large enough, your \"commodities\" become other companies that are growing, enabling you to simply purchase growth and income directly with your capital.In game design we call this a snowball effect or a \"winners win more\" system. It necessarily disadvantages everyone who is not at the top.Unfortunately, there seems to be little appetite for limiting the capacity of capital to accumulate in only a few winners.",
