The glitch at the end did look quite promising. I guess we can't really rule out integer overflows for certain, so maybe one day we'll have enough compute to brute force all the combinations.",

These, of course, had little traction in Europe. How was it in baseball friendly geographies? How did the popularity of the baseball games compare to the Olympics titles?",

I would expect optimizer to be able to do anything a rapid fire joystick could, so if the simulation code could be tricked that way, should it not have become apparent during the brute forcing? The other option is, of course, that you exploited a problem with the input handling instead. But then, the result presumably could not be stored in a replay file, right? Otherwise, again, the optimizer could have found it, after all. Were you able to replay those huge jumps?",
