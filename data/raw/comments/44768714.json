    "textPlain": "Cool but ... this also sounds like hording behavior. The number of things I've saved over the years only to throw them away years later and realize that saving them in the first place was a waste of time.In the 90s my friend's mom would video tape AMC movies. She had 300+ tapes. Maybe she had a few rare ones but now all those movies are available on demand either legally or illegally and in much better quality. Another friend kept all of his 1980s computer magazines (Byte, etc...) and moved these extremely heavy boxes through 30+ years of moves. I doubt he ever opened a single magazine since the moment he saved them. Then they all appeared on The Archive and he finally got rid of them.To be clear, I have a few youtube videos saved on my local storage. I'm just thinking that saving every video I watch reminds me of the things I've personally over-saved.Actually that reminds me. I met up with the magazine saving friend recently which is when I verified that he finally got rid of his stash. It made me think about things I'm still saving that if I reflect on I know I will never actually look at. For example I have box of about eight 3.5 inch floppy disks from my Amiga days. The odds that I'm going to get an Amiga or download an Amiga emu and get a drive to read those are close enough to zero that I should throw them away. Similarly I have a book of CD-ROMs of backed up data from the 90s. There's a close to 0% chance that I'm never going to bother look at their contents.",

    "textPlain": "Related, but this is something that I would like if browsers gave more importance to.Literally a few moments ago I was playing a video from a Nitter instance (Twitter proxy), and wanted to save it with Firefox but nope. Firefox already has the video there, I can see in the developer tools that it's playing from a blob. Even if the blob is then modified on-the-fly, why can't I right-click it and save that blob that you already have? If it's a stream, why can't I dump it? You are already playing it, you already have the bytes, you can \"cache\" the whole playback into a local file and then let me Right Click -> Save that \"cache\" file. Had to use `yt-dlp`.Similar with bookmarks. When I bookmark something, it would be nice if the current state of the page were saved as a fallback (or at least have a checkbox for this behavior). You already have the rendered page right there. I can literally do `Ctrl+S` and save this page as it is right now, even with this half-typed comment. The code for saving the current state of a page is already there. And you can already link binary data to a bookmark (favicon), and text data (description, tags, etc). I wouldn't even mind if I have to give up the description field in exchange for a base64-encoded version of the bookmarked page, I'd be willing to accept that additional storage requirement.[1]Sites like YouTube that actively work to prevent easy downloads and archiving might still need extensions like the one linked in the submission, but browsers don't make it easy to save some data that they already have, and it's difficult enough to contribute to (or patch for yourself) those massive codebases unless you are already familiar with them.I'm willing to patch things for myself and repackage them for myself, but unfortunately for these things it's easier and more reliable long-term to just do workarounds.(Disclaimer: I'm using Firefox.)[1] EDIT: Having history enabled doesn't seem to do save an offline version, either.",
