For example, I was recently travelling in Gran Canaria and looking for places selling artesan coffee in the south (spoiler: only one in a hotel which took me almost half an hour to even find). Searching for things like \"pourover\" and \"v60\" is usually my go-to signal but unless the cafe mentions this in their description or its mentioned in reviews it's hard to find. I don't think they even index the text on the photos customers take (which will often include the coffee menu behind the cashier).",
