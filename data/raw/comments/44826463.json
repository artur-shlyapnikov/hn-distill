I thought that was a \"common misconception\" and wings don't really work by the \"longer path\" that air takes over the top, and that it was more about angle of attack (which is why planes can fly upside down).It seems like it's actually an ideal \"trick\" question for an LLM actually, since so much content has been written about it incorrectly. I thought at first they were going to demo this to show that it knew better, but it seems like it's just regurgitating the same misleading stuff. So, not a good look.",
