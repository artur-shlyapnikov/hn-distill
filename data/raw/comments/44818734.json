Similarly,\nI had copied files from that repo, but who should trust me?Submodules seemed too heavyweight, so I was contemplating a CI script that compared selected checksums with a clone.  This seems like a great general solution so will take a look at dropping it in!",

    "textPlain": "Hi HN, thanks for sending this to the front page.I'm finding myself needing some resources from other projects in a way that ecosystem-specific dependency management isn't going to help, or I'd be pulling in too many files.Submodules aren't the answer, and some other existing git user-defined commands don't seem to do what I need either.I want a file from another repository, and the ability to pin it, and track it in the future, or just always be up-to-date by using the default HEAD commit value set in `.git-remote-files`.    git fetch-file add https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World README\n    git fetch-file pull\n\nLet's me track the README file from the octocat/Hello-World repository, and pull down the file. A record of it is then saved in `.git-remote-files`.Let me know if you have any questions!",
