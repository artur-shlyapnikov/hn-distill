I think it’s fine for schools to monitor there own platforms but weird for the government to monitor all platforms haphazardly.",

I am not exaggerating at all when I say that being spotted outside your classroom was an immediate expulsion, with not even enough time between classes to pee or use your locker (two minutes, we had to run). As part of the escalation, the fire alarm began being pulled at least twice a day. Any student who had even a moment alone with one would pull it immediately. Absolute chaos and a direct result of power collapse due to a racist, authoritarian school board that only knew how to wield institutional violence.For this reason, my kid will always have a phone in order to protect themselves from administrative abuse. I will fight for that tooth and nail. I had over 40 write-ups in just elementary school for refusing entertain abuse from authoritarian staff, and I'll be a failure if my kid doesn't walk the same path.",
