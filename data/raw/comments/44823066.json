Please, we need to stop terrifying children with this lazy oppression, this is not worth the damage to society we’re causing by conditioning kids this way.",

I don’t understand how having a phone helps here except to add even more distraction in school and another avenue for surveillance.The kids used a school communication program to say something racist. Schools should monitor their communication platforms.The only thing I disagree with is the level of punishment (sending a kid to jail for a night).",
