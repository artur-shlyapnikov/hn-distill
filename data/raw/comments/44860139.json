    "textPlain": "It's everywhere.You design a new transmission to comply with federal regulations.  The transmission is mostly an upgrade of previous designs and built in cooperation with multiple vendors.  It's actually not a bad unit.Which is a problem because it will be too reliable.  So you take a small accessory component,  like a valve body,  and you undersize it and built it out of inappropriate materials.  It now starves the transmission,  causes it to run hot,  and the nice transmission cooks itself to death under even the slightest load.The hope is you won't even bother to buy and install a new $7000 part.  Just scrap the car and get a new one!If you're buying a new vehicle,  find your favorite search engine,  then search for \"car model year reliability upgrade.\"  You're almost certainly going to want to get a few of those done if you expect the car to be driving in more than 5 years.",

    "textPlain": "Maybe owning a Corolla for ten years as my first car and now a fairly old Highlander screwed up my baseline understanding of how car ownership should work. If I paid that much for a car and it lasted five years I would talk to a lawyer about a lawsuit. I've never done that before and never really think about doing that but that's completely unacceptable.I certainly would never ever buy from that brand again. I don't know how they expect to have repeat customers. Judging from what I've heard though it sounds like they're struggling to get first customers and the new \"cars\" are just pilling up.Between the car scams, the housing scams etc we could be facing a pretty steeply deflationary environment in the next couple years. I can't imagine the banks will continue financing this insanity for too much longer.",
