    "textPlain": "The fastest way of doing a heap I've found is generally: Don't. For many of the relevant operations (graph search, merging streams, etc.), you can do just as well with a winner-tree; it can usually be updated branch-free with min/max operations, whereas with a heap you'll usually have completely unpredictable branches for every single operation.A winner-tree, or its counterpart the loser-tree (for min instead of max), is a very simple binary tree: Bottom layer is all your values (2^N of them). The layer above that is the highest of pairs of values. The layer above that is the highest of pairs of pairs. And so on, until you get to the top of the tree, which contains the largest value. Updating a value is trivial; you overwrite the relevant one at the bottom, and then run exactly log2(n) max operations upwards until the you hit the root. Inserting and deleting may, of course, be more complicated.",

As far as constructing heaps, don’t forget about (linear-time) heapify, which can be significantly faster if you have a bunch of elements and want to construct a heap with all of them in it. (This doesn’t get you a linear-time heap sort because you’ll still pay the full linearithmic price for the subsequent pop_heaps.)",
