There is also little need to reach back to medieval times when comparatively less exploitative (but still imperfect) apprenticeship systems are alive and well in the trades today.One-on-one practical instruction related specifically to what you want to do is awesome, but there are a lot of difficulties in incentivizing people to supply such instruction.",

    "textPlain": "The author is a good writer, able to expand upon (and illustrate) ideas articulately and convincingly. However, quite a lot of this doesn't quite apply to actual practice in education, particularly in science.High-school and undergraduate science classes tend to pair lectures with labs. Practical work is very much the focus of those labs, and the lab instructors work closely with students who need help.  And a postgraduate degree typically involves a student working side-by-side with a professor on practical work.As for the pyramid model, I think the author makes some good points, especially for the grade-school level.  However, it's simply a fact that being comfortable with adding comes in handy before moving on to multiplying.Good teachers find ways to motivate students, and adjust those ways as the years flow by. They know how to do their job, and I trust them to find the best practices.One thing I've heard from many teachers, especially those who are notably effective, is that teaching theorists are not of much help.  And I see that in the silly trends that higher-ups impose on teachers.  That way of teaching multiplication that has worked for generations?  No good -- we must scrap it.  The practice of teaching students to write cursive?  So quaint - time to toss that in the trash bin. Years later, I see the results of these trends, when students come to university.The problem of teaching theorists coming up with silly ideas is a result, I fear, of the system of educating educators.  How do you get a PhD in a subject?  You have to come up with a new idea.  Nobody got an advanced graduate degree in education by writing a thesis that said \"teaching is fine as it is.\"  No, that PhD student has to say \"this is broken, and here's how to fix it.\"  But some things just aren't quite broken, not really.  Sure, some adjustments might be helpful.  More one-on-one tutoring would be great.  Although then, the non-theorist immediately sees a problem: we don't have enough teac",

It was a 'self paced' electrical engineering course where we were given a textbook and free to advance through it at our own pace - kind of farcically, since you needed to complete at least 2 chapters per week to finish by the end of the semester.Moving forward to the next chapter required, exactly as described in that paper, the completion of a problem set and then a score of at least 90% on a test demonstrating mastery of the previous chapter, sometimes accompanied by also demonstrating that skill in a lab. But far from 1 on 1, this entire class was effectively 0 on infinity. The teaching assistant/proctors that we engaged with were there only to grade your work and provided minimal feedback.And indeed it was one of the most educational 'classes' I ever took. But I think this challenges the concept that it has anything to do with 1 on 1 attention. But rather the outcome seems practically tautological - a good way to get people to perform to the point of mastery is to require that they perform to the point of mastery. Of course, at scale, all you're really doing is weeding out the people that are unable to achieve mastery.

    "textPlain": "I'd generalize this even further. Math, especially higher level math, often turns into a sort of puzzle. And solving quadratic equations is the first step going from learning how to execute basic arithmetic to using it in the process of solving a puzzle.The fact that these puzzles can then be used to do cool things is almost just a fortunate coincidence.",

    "textPlain": "> a pedagogical environment engineered for optimal knowledge and skill acquisitionI'm not sure how many of those we have available to us. Many are compromised by politics, funding, or the need to act as a daycare.I learned a lot at the various schools I went to, but the amount I learned seemed to correlate more directly with how invested I was in learning than how well the school was funded. Plenty of schools with better per-pupil funding had significantly worse student achievement rates than where I was.The only real exception to that is not all schools offer the same curriculum. Back in my day, not every secondary / high school had someone who could teach calculus, though now there's districts that are getting rid of calculus entirely to promote anti-racism. Honestly, I think learning calculus in high school was good for me, even if I've really only needed to calculate integrals once in my programming career.At University, things were much the same. Undergrad courses focused a bit more on synthesizing than memorizing compared to high school, but not really by much.All of this is to say that I'm not really sure it's fair to knock the apprentice program since we don't directly experience optimal pedagogy elsewhere.",

    "textPlain": "Granted I've been out of school for decades. The textbooks were always an accessory to classroom instruction and not intended for stand-alone learning. Math students quickly figured out that the most important thing was doing the problems, the text was essentially a reference, and the classroom was for guidance through the concepts, and for motivation.Of course the humanities classes were about books, so learning how to study the books themselves was a major part of the practice.Programming seems to lend itself particularly well to self learning because the computer allows for endless trial-and-error practice.",

I guess you don't just dive right in, otherwise you wouldn't be getting good feedback ;)What I really hate is explaining the solution before explaining the problem. It's a terrible way to teach and it's quite common. I like to say that there are two bad ways to teach: The cookbook (do this, then do that) and the maths textbook (solutions without problems or context). The good way is a combination of them with some additional things that neither of them has, like motivating examples, relevant anecdotes etc.",
