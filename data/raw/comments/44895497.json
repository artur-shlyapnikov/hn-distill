    "textPlain": "Medieval craftsmen often ran what we would consider to be sweatshops, with many young (i.e. child) apprentices banging out work and not receiving much instruction in exchange.  We're romanticizing and idealizing a past that was, in realty, often quite exploitative.There are reasons why we started sending children to schools rather than businesses for basic education.  There is also little need to reach back to medieval times when comparatively less exploitative (but still imperfect) apprenticeship systems are alive and well in the trades today.One-on-one practical instruction related specifically to what you want to do is awesome, but there are a lot of difficulties in incentivizing people to supply such instruction.",

You can watch a yootoob video on rebuilding a carburetor all day, but you don't know nuttin until you take it apart yourself.I decided to learn to ride a dirtbike. I took some personal instruction from an expert, and promptly crashed. Again and again and again. Finally, my body figured out how to coordinate the controls.Can't learn how to double clutch downshift from watching a video, either.",

When classroom instruction is done one-on-one, learning dramatically improves. This is called the \"two sigma problem\" in the educational literature. Ignoring this aspect gives the other factors discussed in TFA exaggerated significance.",

    "textPlain": "Practice is extremely important, and I don't think its importance is exaggerated at all.I would expect students in an environment with a typically high student-to-teacher ratio, but who actually practice what they're being taught, will significantly outperform students who are taught one-on-one by a personal tutor but rarely actually perform the thing that they're trying to learn.Obviously, \"¿Por Qué No Los Dos?\" - doing both is even better. But tutoring isn't obviously superior to practice.As a personal anecdote (not to replace the above general arguments), I've gotten several hundred hours of one-on-one tutoring in an advanced field of physics from a number of experts, and yet I learned significantly less than I have from significantly fewer hours studying a separate (but no less difficult) field of math when I actually worked the problems.",

    "textPlain": "> a pedagogical environment engineered for optimal knowledge and skill acquisitionI'm not sure how many of those we have available to us. Many are compromised by politics, funding, or the need to act as a daycare.I learned a lot at the various schools I went to, but the amount I learned seemed to correlate more directly with how invested I was in learning than how well the school was funded. Plenty of schools with better per-pupil funding had significantly worse student achievement rates than where I was.The only real exception to that is not all schools offer the same curriculum. Back in my day, not every secondary / high school had someone who could teach calculus, though now there's districts that are getting rid of calculus entirely to promote anti-racism. Honestly, I think learning calculus in high school was good for me, even if I've really only needed to calculate integrals once in my programming career.At University, things were much the same. Undergrad courses focused a bit more on synthesizing than memorizing compared to high school, but not really by much.All of this is to say that I'm not really sure it's fair to knock the apprentice program since we don't directly experience optimal pedagogy elsewhere.",
