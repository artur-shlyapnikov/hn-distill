I don’t want to be in that group (chasing power and wealth), I just want to have a nice life, a good life, maybe better than a typical engineer. But I gave away a lot of my money. I’m very comfortable with who I am, I’m not one of those private jet people.\nPart of my philosophy was everything you do should have an element of fun in it. I came up with the formula for happiness, what life is about. Happiness to me is smiles minus frowns, H=S-F.

And I just said, I want to be in the middle, where I can associate with the maximum number of people. \nPeople are one of the most important parts of this life. Who you are, who your friends are, how you can talk to them—it was important to me because I was shy; I was an outsider. And I wanted to be in the middle, not one of these extreme \"way up\" people where you can only deal with other \"way up\" type people. \nPart of my thinking, was to be open-spirited to people. Part of that was not to build a hierarchy. [..] I wanted to build a philosophy, not a hierarchy. Just say, \"Hey, I'm going to present how I think,\" and if somebody else has a different way of thinking, they just have a different mind. They're not bad, they're just different.

    "textPlain": "Maybe I'm not creative enough but I've tried this thought exercise with friends and it's a fun one.The question is, try to spend $1bn on stuff. Go.So then you start with big ticket items (like maybe a yacht or a house). That gets you to your first $500m. After that, stuff gets WAY \"cheaper\" where you just run out of things generally before even hitting $1bn.And then at the end of it we try to imagine what it's like having stuff worth $250bn. And there's just no way to make that tangible.I did try this with my son and he said he'd buy an A-list soccer team. But I feel that starts to get into \"buying companies that make you MORE money\" territory.At a much smaller scale, it seems to be that $10mn is so much that you could live in a $2m house (good by any standard in any location), have a stable of cars, have full-time help, fly first class or even private everywhere, and vacation as much as you want. Or am I off by a lot given inflation?",
