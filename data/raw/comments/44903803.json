He had his trade-marked backpack full of electronics on his torso.Approached him gingerly to ask, \"Are you, umm, Mr Woz?\"If he seemed surprised / annoyed, he didn't show.Then I got tongue-tied... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ In a brief second, the entire history of Apple came flooding to me...I blurted at him that he was a boyhood hero of mine and just thanked him for his contributions, etc. (which is true, I do admire him)He seemed surprised. He said folks these days have sports heros, and was glad to hear what I said. Inquired about me / my work (also tech), my brief journey, etc. Exchanged a few pleasantries. That was it.I didn't have any elevator pitch or anything. I came away genuinely happy having met him in person.",

A lot of basic ethics is truth and honesty, and I’m going to be an honest person. I’m not going to be corrupted to where I do things for the sake of money. I don’t want to be in that group (chasing power and wealth), I just want to have a nice life, a good life, maybe better than a typical engineer. But I gave away a lot of my money. I’m very comfortable with who I am, I’m not one of those private jet people.\nPart of my philosophy was everything you do should have an element of fun in it. I came up with the formula for happiness, what life is about. Happiness to me is smiles minus frowns, H=S-F. Increase your smiles, do a lot of fun things, enjoy entertainment, talk with people, make jokes. That’s creativity.\"\n-- The Guardian interview, 3 May 2016\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/may/03/wisdom...\"My starting point was the desire to be a good person.\nSo, I came up with a lot of different values, largely based on truth being the most important thing of all, and the value of what's called ethics. And I just said, I want to be in the middle, where I can associate with the maximum number of people. \nPeople are one of the most important parts of this life. Who you are, who your friends are, how you can talk to them—it was important to me because I was shy; I was an outsider. And I wanted to be in the middle, not one of these extreme \"way up\" people where you can only deal with other \"way up\" type people. \nPart of my thinking, was to be open-spirited to people. Part of that was not to build a hierarchy. [..] I wanted to build a philosophy, not a hierarchy.
