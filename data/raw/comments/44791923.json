    "textPlain": "Hi there! Thank you for the glowing review! I'm the cofounder of Krea and I'm glad you liked Sangwu's blog post. The team is reading it.You'll probably get a lot of replies around how this model is a just a fine-tune and a potential disregard for LoRAs, as if we didn't know about them. While the reality is that we have thousands of them running in our platform. Sadly there's simply so much a LoRA and a fine-tune can do before you run into issues that can't be solved until you apply more advanced techniques such as curated post-training runs (including reinforcement learning-based techniques such as Diffusion-PPO[1]), or even large-scale pre-training.-[1]: https://diffusion-ppo.github.io",

    "textPlain": "This is what finetuning has been all about since stable diffusion 1.5 and especially SDXL. And even something StabilityAI base models excelled at in the open weights category. (Midjourney has always been the champion, but proprietary)Sadly with SAI going effectively bankrupt things changed, their rushed 3.0 model was broken beyond repair and the later 3.5 just unfinished or something (the api version is remarkably better), gens full of errors and artifacts even though the good ones looked great. It turned out hard to finetune as well.In the mean time flux got released, but that model can be fried (as in one concept trained in) but not finetuned (this krea flux is not based on the open  weights flux). Add to that that as models got bigger training/finetuning now costs an arm and a leg, so here we are, a year after flux got released a good finetune is celebrated as the next new thing :)",

    "textPlain": "Agreed. From the article:> Model builders have been mostly focused on correctness, not aesthetics. Researchers have been overly focused on the extra fingers problem.While that might be true for the foundational models - the author seems to be neglecting the tens of thousands of custom LoRAs to customize the look of an image.> Users fight the “AI Look” with heavy prompting and even fine-tuningIMHO it is significantly easier to fix an aesthetic issue  than an adherence issue. You can take a poor quality image, use ESRGAN upscalers, img2img using it as a ControlNet, run it through a different model, add LoRAs, etc.I have done some nominal tests with Krea but mostly around adherence. I'd be curious to know if they've reduced the omnipresent bokeh / shallow depth of field given that it is Flux based.",

The blindspots are glaring when you're looking for them, but the decreased overhead of training LoRA now means we can locally supplement a good base model on commodity hardware in a matter of hours.Also, there's a lot of \"samehand\" and hand hiding in BFL and other models. Part of the reason I don't use any MaaS is how hard they were focusing on manufacturing superficial impressions over increasing fundamental understanding and direction following.
