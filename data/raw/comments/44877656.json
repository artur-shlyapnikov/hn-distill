    "textPlain": "NAL, but IMO it's legal & political maneuvering. DOJ asked Judge Mehta to consider forcing divestiture of Chrome after Google was found to illegally maintained a search monopoly. If it's determined the divestiture is feasible, especially with an existing more-or-less \"credible buyer\" at the ready, it looks executable. The offer is basically crafted to fit the DOJ/regulator concerns, ie everything is build around \"least disruptive\": keeping Google the default search engine, etc. Furthermore, just by doing this, they are putting ideas out there about what an \"acceptable buyer\" is and puts a number to the discussion about \"what Chrome is worth\". Purely remedies chess and an attempt to own the narrative. Google's going to say no, at least as-is, but this certainly throws a wrench in the works. Lots more moves to be made.",
