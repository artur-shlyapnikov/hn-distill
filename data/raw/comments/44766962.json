    "textPlain": "I remember my first music (note reading) lesson.  We got a paper with sentences, and the teacher replaced each word with either 'titi' or 'ta' and we had to repeat it.  Our homework for that week was an A4 paper full of words and sentences, and we had to replace them with 'titi' or 'ta' as made sense from context.  I somehow managed to get a good grade, but it confused the hell out of me, and made me think of giving up music as too hard.  I remember it bothering me the whole week.The second lesson, the teacher says: 'Now we have to learn some hard words.  The 'ti' is called a quarter note, and the ta is a half note'.  Finally, the whole thing started to make sense to me.  Then the teacher says: 'But don't try to understand that, these are very hard words for adults, just memorize them and do what makes sense from context.'  Trough that lesson, the teacher kept stressing that same message:  Too hard, adult words, do what makes sense instead and use the hard words only to impress the outsiders.I've kept a deep distrust for teachers telling me to do what makes sense in context. I've always kept asking for the actual rules and correct words instead, however complicated they were.  It happened a few times later in life too, like my economy teacher giving 'debit' and 'credit' guidelines based on vibes without telling they should be balanced, with subtraction being complicated math according to her.",

We went through it while my kid was in kindergarten, and after that, I absolutely believe what I've heard from parents who did it successfully a bit earlier. And it didn't prevent my kid from figuring out how to use context or recognize full words. Reading English is a lot, and kids are resourceful; if we teach the 'slow' but reliable way to read, they'll be happy to feel out shortcuts.The toughest thing was getting a reliable bit of time each day to sit down and do it. Routine, cajoling, and rewards were all involved. So was keeping it lighthearted; the kid has to be on board! Each lesson has straightforward exercises then a brief story, very short at first, longer later in the book. We'd do the exercises and one read of the story, then kid would read the story to my partner. We started in September, and I remember by Halloween the kid was reading candy wrappers. After finishing it, the next big thing was finding stories the kid genuinely liked to keep it going. Continuing to read together after the lessons ended helped: for a while, kids will keep running into lots of new exceptions to the usual rules, etc.English spelling and pronunciation are a lot, and the book is also, implicitly, a catalog of the tricks English plays on kids and other learners. Part of the book uses a semi-phonetic alphabet where e.g. ee and sh/ch/th have distinct glyphs, but it all still looks enough like English that the jump to regular writing later in the book is doable for the kid. Even with that alphabet, the book has to teach common words like \"is\" and \"was\" as exceptions (with s sounding like z). Decades later one can forget little kids deal with all this and eventually handle it like second nature.The book's originator thought that you could teach math with a broadly similar approach--breaking things down into very small steps and practicing them in isolation then in larger ta",

I mean, if I were one of Bezmenov's supposed evil-genius agents of influence seeking to undermine and ruin Western civilization, introducing the way that illiterate people bluff their way through reading as the standard for reading education would definitely be in my toolkit of delightfully devilish methods of cultural sabotage.My wife and I both acquired reading very early -- age three or so. So I don't remember the details of how I acquired it, only driving some of my teachers nuts once I actually did enter school, because I didn't follow the timetable they learned in their expensive university education of when and how kids are supposed to learn to read, do math, or anything else really. But I suspect that one thing you can do to help kids with their reading skills is to read to them, starting very early. My wife and I have similar experience of being read to by our moms, eventually seeing the ability to read as a \"magic power\"[0] of sorts, and becoming determined to learn this skill, so that we could unlock the tremendous power of books and writing for ourselves. Contrariwise, the kids I've known who struggled with reading early on (even my own sister when I was younger) tended to get bored quickly, give up, and want to do other things.Reading is an intellectually demanding skill, much like computer programming except for degree -- there's a bit at the beginning that's really hard, because it's based on insights that you don't have yet, and you just kind of have to bro through it. Those who think it just \"comes naturally\" or whatever are just really, really well practiced at it. You gotta keep your eyes on the prize in order to stay determined to power through the hard bits. Inspiring kids like this begins at home, though school and even television programs like Reading Rainbow (when I was growing up) certainly help.[0] When t",

One of my sons learned to read mostly using phonics, whereas the other one I think learned through a mixture of phonics and whole word recognition (not necessarily taught by the school - he just seemed to remember and recognise words and not really need phonics so much).It was interesting seeing how our particular school did teach reading using phonics. They used something called a 'Thrass chart'. It had 120 boxes, each one containing a letter or combination of letters that could make a particular sound and an example of a word containing that combination and sound. So, importantly, some combinations of letters appeared more than once on the chart.It looks rather complicated when you first looked it at but obviously they introduced it all very gradually. So if somebody was stuck on a word, it would be 'Let's find those letters on the Thrass chart and see what sounds they could make'. I can't find a good image of it online, but you can see a slightly blurred one on this page: https://www.thrass.co.uk/",

I many times found details or explanations others don't because they skimmed over important words or phrasings in highly information-dense text.---I really think foreign words should be read phonetically. Taking the first letter and guessing is an insane way to teach to kids to me. I could imagine they don't pick up new words since they learn to guess words they know instead.

Serbian for example is even more literal with \"write how you say it and say it how you write it\", and that includes \"Britni Spirs\" and \"Arnold Švarceneger\".If you didn't know the spelling for \"xylophone\", you'd assume it's \"zylophone\", but for some reason there's an 'x' there. Waiting in line? Well, you have to \"queue\" but not \"cue\". Sure, historic reasons, like with \"ye olde pub\" not having a \"yee\" there... but it's a pain to learn, especially for children who are not that exposed to englsh texts (but mostly cartoons, especially in my time, where dubbing was almost non-existant). Same for french (ahem \"jouaient\").On the other hand, we have some messed up rules too... slovenia was a part of yugoslavia, but we don't have the leter \"ć\", while most yugoslav countries do. We also have a rule that we write words (especially names) from non-latin alphabets phonetically (president of china is \"Ši Džinping\"), with the exception of serbian cyrilic.  So, let's say you have someone with a surname (anglicized to) Petrovich (\"son of Peter\"). If the person is from croatia, his surname is writen in latin alphabet as \"Petrović\" (note the \"ć\"), and since it' a latin alphabet, we write it \"Petrović\", as the original (same for names with \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"q\"\" that we also don't natively use). If it's someome from russa etc. (cyrillic) or any other non-latin-alphabet using country, he'd be \"Petrovič\" (since we don't have the letter \"ć\" we'd transcribe to \"č\".

I am a whole language person and I've learned to read and retain pretty quickly.Anyways, this totally mirrors the concept of tokenization. Phonics vs whole languge is suspiciously similar to letter, word, and subword tokenization. One wonders if we as human do a proxy for BPE in our brains when we learn to read.To this day I'm an absolutely shitty speller.",

They have natural tendency to do so, which pretty much anyone understands, is counterproductive to reading and must be suppressed.

Encouraging kid to guess what's on paper seems absolutely idiotic.Is Ken Goodman the Andre Wakefield of education, just without the ulterior motiv?",

    "textPlain": "I found this article painful to read, not because reading it was difficult, but because of how deeply flawed it is. It correctly identifies one system of teaching reading as flawed (to put it mildly), but then is an advertisement for another slightly less flawed system by advocating for phonetics. The problem with phonetics is that it is unreliable when applied to the English language. The following video shows the problem:https://youtu.be/uZV40f0cXF4English does not follow the alphabetic principle, so any ability to sound out words is vestigial. It might work for a number of words, but then you will hit one where it does not work. I remember as a child, trying to sound out words as I was told to do, and getting them wrong. I eventually realized that the word pronunciations had to be memorized. I did not understand why until I was an adult. The reason is that English writing does not follow the alphabetic principle unlike many other languages which do. This is why schools in English speaking countries have spelling bees, while countries where languages that follow the alphabetic principle do not. Just about all of the students in the latter countries will always get the spelling of words in their local language correct, 100% of the time, such that there will be no winner and thus there is no point to a spelling bee.Look at the actual sounds used in American English:https://americanipachart.com/There are 39. Just for fun, British Received Pronunciation has 44:https://englishwithlucy.com/phonemic-chart/Let’s not forget foreign loanwords, which might or might not be pronounced using the native foreign pronunciation. With only 26 letters, how are people supposed to ever be able to sound out words correctly? The only way is to memorize what is right in advance, which is the only way poor Ricky Ricardo ever learned how to pronounce the -ough words in English. It is also how my younger self learned to read. The article suggests this is called the “whole word” approach, and",

    "textPlain": "I'll keep the self-promotion to a minimum, but I have been spending lots of time reading on the science consensus on how children actually become fluent readers as part of my upcoming product Pictures Are For Babies (https://picturesareforbabies.com), a literacy program that uses a deliberate practice engine I created to teach literacy from A-B-C to post-secondary level.Phonics is all the rage, and I was planning to make it central to my pedagogy, but it turns out the answer is a bit more complicated, especially if you want to work with children with reading difficulties.Phonics is part of the answer, but it's only the first step. Introducing children to the explicit mapping of graphemes to phonemes (letter to sounds) teaches decoding, but skilled reading is not decoding.Actual reading is developed through a process called orthographic mapping. The result of this process is storing the grapheme to phoneme mappings in long-term memory for immediate retrieval. The words stored in this way form a sight vocabulary that spans tens of thousands of words in fluent readers.When taught only phonics, kids run the risk of plateauing in later grades. It's not evident at first because the material they are given is simple and deals with concrete subjects (e.g. \"Mike got a bunny for his birthday\"). Later material uses many more words that don't follow phonics \"rules\" and deal with abstract material. Under these circumstances, decoding is too slow and effortful and leaves little remaining capacity to deal with harder tasks like comprehension.The main cause of issues in developing this sight vocabulary is phonological deficits, not IQ, motivation, intelligence, visual processing, or attention like one might imagine. Kids with these deficits have trouble understanding that words are made up of smaller sound units and cannot work with them. Because of that, they cannot store the mapping efficiently and their vocabulary and fluency is limited.Thankfully, the best interventions that fi",
