Then you look at far things with the former, and near things with the latter. Good old stereo vision is somewhat impacted, but not too badly apparently.Anyone got experience/comments on that?

Much of the submission dossier (trial design, product description) can be written ahead of time, so it’s really the results that need to be drafted.The FDA can approve in as little as 3-4 months for an accelerated approval, but it can take up to 12 months.Compare that with a paper being written and reviewed across multiple authors (3-6 months if you’re lucky), then submitting to multiple journals for review and feedback (6 months), then final submission and peer review (1-2 months), then any additional edits (1 month), then final slating for publication after article is type set, all figures are sized, article laid out and final version (1-2 months).So all in the FDA takes less time (3-12 months) than publishing (12-17 months).",

    "textPlain": "I've been doing this my whole life (about 20 years now) with contacts. I started in high school for fun after noticing that my contacts made it harder to see super-fine details at very short distances. I read an article about how some motivated people wore custom glasses which inverted the world upside-down, but their brains eventually compensated and flipped the image they perceived. I started wearing just one contact (alternating right, both, or left eye) and despite a diopter of -3.5 my brain learned to use the blurry color of my uncorrected eye to provide an acceptable level of depth perception while only giving me the sight picture from the corrected eye.Thanks to an ophthalmologist with flexible practices, I'd later also managed to get some variety in my contacts - a bit higher power for sailing, where extreme long distance sight is helpful.For activities which require precise stereo vision and/or maximum fine detail (soldering, foosball, skiing, sailing, etc) I prefer two contacts (or none, in the case of soldering). For general daily life I still enjoy one contact - my brain will use the picture from the uncorrected eye for close-up stuff, including computing, and the corrected picture for farther things, like driving. It's not perfect; I have to turn my head a lot more in one direction to check for traffic/etc and sometimes objects in the foreground create a large block of blurry vision.But it's quite nice for daily life where I constantly switch from activities which are close (computers/reading) to far (everything else).Like 'heikkilevanto, I may have to go back to stereo vision soon - my eyes are reaching the age where they're not as quick to focus and I don't see as much detail. Close-up work is getting much more difficult with just one eye. I can no longer solder at all with mono-vision, depth perception now only works for longer distances and not shorter ones. And far-vision is losing detail, so having two contacts makes it much easier to ascertain wh",
