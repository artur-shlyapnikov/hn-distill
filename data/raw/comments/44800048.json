    "textPlain": "Interesting that the video being used as a showcase is dropping so many frames. Is QuickShell particularly heavy, the system recording particularly anemic, or something else? For the first half of the video I didn't realize QuickShell supported transitions at all and thought it only had hard cuts between different states. It looks like a very interesting project though and a worthy time sink, especially with those transitions being supported.",
