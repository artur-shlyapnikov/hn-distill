QML is so obviously one of the best things that happened recently for GUI development, but it's not used enough.Browsing quickly through the docs I can see we've made some of the same choices. Although I have no plans to support anything other than X11/i3wm right now (simply because that's what I use). And I have things a little bit more clearly separated. I have a small library (qi3pc)[1] to bring i3's IPC to Qt's signal/slot mechanism. And a separate project (buffalo)[2] that's a bar that uses qi3pc. None of them have reached 1.0 yet. That should be soon for qi3pc. And Buffalo eventually. Since they aren't released yet, docs are sparse (for buffalo mostly) and I haven't talked about it online much, but there's a little preview here[3] for any interested.1. https://git.sr.ht/~hantz/qi3pc/tree/staging/hantz\n2. https://git.sr.ht/~hantz/buffalo/tree/staging/hantz\n3. https://www.freelists.org/post/i3-discuss/I3bar-doubleheight...",
