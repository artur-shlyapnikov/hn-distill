    "textPlain": "> A norm around consensus-based decision-making discouraged compromise from all countriesSo, a maladaptive systemic influence was noted, but they continued to focus on lower-level discussions around plastics. When will we start to see that it is the communication protocols that are driving this failure, and that good-faith bargaining is a fallacy, when there is profit to be made? I would like to know how this is being addressed, and which other proposals have been made that represent alternative routes to progress - specifically ones that do not require vested interest to forego their short-term benefits in favour of others' long-term needs.> But only one speaker was able to give a statement before the United States and Kuwait asked the chair to cut them off and conclude the meetingIf the observers' voices are so important, why schedule them for the very end? Yet another structural failing that demonstrates that the scale of thinking and organisation being employed is insufficient for the stated task.",

The problem is littering and poor waste management.You can solve plastic pollution in two ways. Either crackdown on inappropriate waste disposal, or eliminate the use of plastics. One is actually possible, the other isn't.Edit: although to be fair there are a range of \"harm reduction\" type measures. But if you focus on those, you might solve 10% of the problem and just drain energy from actually solving waste management.",
