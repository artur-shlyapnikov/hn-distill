I try to avoid it as much as possible but more often than not, the only option (other than not being a consumer) is to purchase a product contained in plastic.I’ll use the simple example of  dental floss. When I was younger, you could purchase dental floss in a small circular metal container. Today, almost every option of dental floss available for purchase is in an often oversized / non-recyclable plastic container with non-recyclable plastic packaging.This actually prompted me to once again go on the hunt for that little metal container of dental floss from my youth, and I actually found an option! A US company called Poh sells dental floss in metal container. Just thought I’d share, for anyone else that is dumbfounded when they have to buy more plastic wrapped plastic products to practice good dental hygiene.",

    "textPlain": "You are not wrong. We tend to zoom in on on the wrong problems. Most of continental Europe produces a lot of waste. Almost none of that ends up in the oceans. The problem exists mostly in coastal areas with a lack of legislation and rules or just a generally a sloppy attitude to cleaning up. And shipping in international waters. Once you are in international waters, there are very little rules and essentially no enforcement. Most of the problems in our oceans come from very specific countries and shipping just dumping their waste directly in the oceans. The problem is not the oil industry but some countries not managing their waste effectively.Of course the best thing is just not having one time use plastics to begin with. But we tend to over-emphasize the problem and focus on the wrong parts. People using e.g. straws in their drinks is maybe unnecessary but in tons of plastic it's a very minor part of the actual problem. Especially if most of it goes into the trash and ends up in a landfill or incinerator. E.g. People using plastic or paper straws in Berlin makes no measurable impact. It's all very symbolic. The Spree, the main river that runs through Berlin and the only way trash could physically make it to oceans, has been pretty clean since the DDR stopped dumping toxic waste into it a few decades ago. I don't think rule changes in recent years for one time use plastics made any measurable difference.It's more of a problem on beaches and near coastal areas where some people can't be bothered to clean up after themselves. You see the same on public roads or train tracks where people just toss their crap out of the window. This is the root of the problem: too many people just do the wrong thing without even thinking about it.IMHO littering fines and more effective enforcement would be very appropriate and should be fairly uncontroversial.
