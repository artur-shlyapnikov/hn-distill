    "textPlain": "I don't know why Perplexity in particular gets everyone in a nit. It's not even particularly special: a user inputs a query, an AI model does a web search and fetches some pages on the user's behalf, and then it serves the result to the user.Putting aside that other products, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and modern Google Search have the same \"AI-powered web search\" functionality, I can't see how this is meaningfully different from a user doing a web search and pasting a bunch of webpages into an LLM chat box.> But what about ad revenue?The user could be using an ad blocker. If they're using Perplexity at all, they probably already are. There's no requirement for a user agent to render ads.> But robots.txt!!!11`robots.txt` is for recursive, fully automated requests. If a request is made on behalf of a user, through direct user interaction, then it may not be followed and IMO shouldn't be followed. If you really want to block a user agent, it's up to you to figure out how to serve a 403.> It's breaking copyright by reproducing my content!Yes, so does the user's browser. The purpose of a user agent is to fetch and display content how the user wants. The manner in which that is done is irrelevant.",

    "textPlain": "There's a difference between what is technically feasible and what is allowed, legally or even morally.Just because it is possible -- or even easy -- to essentially steal from newspapers/other media outlets, doesn't make it right, or legal.  The people behind it put in labor, financial resources, and time to create a product that, like almost every other service, has terms attached -- and those usually come with some form of monetization.  Maybe it is a paywall, maybe it is advertisements -- but it is there.Using an adblocker, or finding some loophole around a paywall, etc, are all very easy to do technically, as any reader of this site knows.  That said, the media outlet doesn't have to allow it.  And when it is violated on an industrial scale, like Perplexity, then they can be understandably upset and take legal action.  And that includes any AI (or other technology, for that matter) that is a wrapper around plagiarism.Sites opted in to Google originally because it fed them traffic.  They most likely did not opt in to an AI rewriter that takes their work and republishes it without any compensation.",
