    "textPlain": "So I appreciate the aim here, but for me to trust any video editor, I need to see an example timeline that’s like, 30 minutes long with clips from at least 10 1080p video files and at least one effect on each track.And for the record I wouldn’t consider that a stress test (a stress test would be more like 3 hours, 100 tracks, 4K and like a dozen precomps that are being reversed or something). That’s just to make sure this thing won’t fall over during casual usage.You may be inclined to respond that your editor is targeting beginner editors, to which I’d note that beginner editors are MUCH less disciplined than experts when it comes to trimming footage, splitting things up into comps, pre-rendering chunks, using proxies, etc. Beginner editors (I’d know, I used to be one) will dump a 1 hour 4K-HDR iPhone video of a presenter speaking, and a screen recording of presentation slides they accidentally took in 4K60 into your timeline. Being able to demonstrate that you’ve got that level of memory management handled is what separates video editors people can use from mere “good ideas”.Edit: Another thought, you call your product “Cursor for video editing”, and that’s a valid goal. But bear in mind that a LARGE part of why Cursor is successful is because they didn’t try to build an IDE from scratch. They got to absorb all of the nice UX (not to mention the extensive plugin ecosystem) of VS Code, and then spend their time on AI features. If that’s how you want to spend your time, you definitely don’t want to be building an editor from scratch.",

A web video editor in the big year of 2025 is not going to move the needle. Capcut has a free desktop app that you must compete with. I think a better idea is building a mobile video editor, it's much harder to vibe code. To be the \"Cursor for Video Editing,\" it's a must.",
