That the screen degraded didn't help of course. The reporter doesn't want to use a web dashboard to check out the readings on his indoor air monitor. I think that's a fair comment, maybe just a bit harsh to put it in the not recommended bucket. I understand that this can affect sales quite a bit for a small supplier like AirGradient.It's linked in the article but here it is. https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-indoor-air-quality-monito...",

    "textPlain": "I don't think any of this review is unfair. Shipping a broken product and then covering the fix with your warranty is better than shipping a broken product and telling the consumer to get bent, but worse than shipping a working product. A product that advertises fewer features and delivers them is better than a product that advertises more features and doesn't deliver them. Even in the case of the CO2 sensor, it may be your opinion that a CO2 sensor is critical and can't be done without, but the review is for the feature set at the price point. A device that does fewer things can be a better device depending on price point and, again, reliability.If, however, I concede the author's idea that reviews must have objective criteria, methodology and standards in order to be taken seriously then I'd like to propose the first objective criterion: broken out-of-the-box === not recommended.edit: evidently the device failed after a few months. This doesn't change my final opinion, which is in total agreement with the review, but it deserves to be mentioned because I was incorrect in my facts. For my fellow JS devs, I'm standing by broken out-of-the-box === not recommended, and adding broken within a few months of installing == not recommended.",

Exactly like I do for metrics of production systems in SRE life.The unit also has a series of LEDs across the top and I can read the actual status from 20’ away (which is as far as I can get without going out a window or around a corner).One green led? Good. \nTwo green leds? Meh. \nThree LEDs? They’re red now and that’s not greatSingle red led in the top left in addition to any on the right? Spectrum is having yet another outage (no internet)No LEDs? Not powered onReviewer was overly severe and did his readers a disservice.It’s better imho than my Airthings wave pro, and it lets me get awesome, actionable time series data. It’s sensitive enough to show air quality taking a dive overnight with two people and multiple pets breathing in the same room (one green during the day, three or four red at night), and also to show that adding a half dozen spider plants keeps co2 well in check (consistent one green led).And I can read the air quality from across the room without getting out of bed.",

    "textPlain": "I would much rather prefer AirGradient over IQAir AirVision Pro, despite WIRED’s recent evaluation favouring the latter. Source: I “own” (see below) an IQAir AirVision Pro, which I bought directly from IQAir’s website, and I have seen an AirGradient unit in someone else’s home.One reason is, in fact, the screen. AirVision Pro’s display is bright, but it is bright all of the time; it cannot be made dim enough to make it suitable for use in the bedroom, for example: the blueish white LCD is basically a small light fixture. Furthermore, the contents of the screen are well-readable only at a narrow angle (think when you look straight at it; putting it on top of a tall fridge or down on your windowsill makes it illegible). I would much rather prefer an e-ink display.Second, on their website IQAir states that their air monitors are made in Europe[0]. This is a false claim. In fact, AirVision Pro is made in PRC, as it declared on the box. I would not be against a good product made in PRC, and AirVision Pro is in fact known for good cheracteristics regarding accuracy, but it seems like a dark pattern at best, and they clearly want to mislead customers.Third, the enclosure featured a charging USB port (which is an obsolete micro USB variety incredibly hard to find cables for) that was very finicky and gave up the ghost 3 months in. The device just wouldn’t charge its battery or see any power at all thereafter, so it basically became a brick of cheap plastic for all intents and purposes. I can’t be bothered to disassemble the enclosure and try to repair it since I can’t stand the bright screen anyway and I already got the hang of air quality patterns where I live.It did the job, sure, but if AirGradient’s PM2.5 and carbon dioxide detectors do nearly as good of a job[1] it makes it a much more compelling option for me.Unfortunately, as of the time I last checked, AirGradient shipped to a small set of countries which did not include my area; by comparison, IQAir has a much wide",
