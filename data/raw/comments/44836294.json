    "textPlain": "There's a lot better being done by Boox, and even with colour e-ink in terms of ghosting.  I think a lot of that is software end, though.The one unfortunate thing is that this monitor seems to have a glossy screen, not matte, but maybe that's an additional layer over a dev kit?If this truly is 'open', then it should be trivial to write special X11/Wayland drivers for it, to handle a lot of the ghosting issues at that end.  I think Boox actually refreshes portions of screens, and a double or triple video buffer in X/Wayland could do the same.(One problem with Boox is their relentless phone-home to servers in China, which cannot be disable by normal means.)",

    "textPlain": "It looks amazing for e-ink. You'd probably don't want this for video anyway, besides it's not even in color. I'm impressed that it works at all. For a lot of work though it could be amazing, depending on your environment.Say you'd want to pop outside in the nice weather to do some programming. You quickly find why that wasn't as glamorous as you expected. But if you had a laptop with such a screen I would expect it to work great.",
