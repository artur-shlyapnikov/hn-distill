I've rooted my Kindle Paperwhite and set it up with a terminal and used it to SSH into my laptop just to try it, but the latency makes it a bit irritating just to keep up with typing. To be able to use a fully graphical environment in e-paper, even in grayscale, would be amazing.I built a cyberdeck that primarily uses a pair of XReal AR glasses as its display, but to have the option to use either those or this would be so awesome.",

    "textPlain": "Not sure I understand what I'm looking at.At 0:47, which one is the e-ink, left hand side or right hand side? Initially I thought the e-ink was on the left hand side, but it has SO MUCH GLARE.Also on the intro at 0:10 you can see the glare move across as they tilt it.More glare: 0:26 (left) 0:28 (top left).I have an e-ink reader and it has zero glare. I read it on the beach as clearly as paper, I'm not exaggerating.They've done the hardest part (the latency), how don't know how to explain fumbling this badly on the easy part. It shouldn't have glass in front!!",

    "textPlain": "There's a lot better being done by Boox, and even with colour e-ink in terms of ghosting.  I think a lot of that is software end, though.The one unfortunate thing is that this monitor seems to have a glossy screen, not matte, but maybe that's an additional layer over a dev kit?If this truly is 'open', then it should be trivial to write special X11/Wayland drivers for it, to handle a lot of the ghosting issues at that end.  I think Boox actually refreshes portions of screens, and a double or triple video buffer in X/Wayland could do the same.(One problem with Boox is their relentless phone-home to servers in China, which cannot be disable by normal means.)",

    "textPlain": "It looks amazing for e-ink. You'd probably don't want this for video anyway, besides it's not even in color. I'm impressed that it works at all. For a lot of work though it could be amazing, depending on your environment.Say you'd want to pop outside in the nice weather to do some programming. You quickly find why that wasn't as glamorous as you expected. But if you had a laptop with such a screen I would expect it to work great.",
