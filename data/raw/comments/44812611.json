And they informed my philosophy on how the internet should be. People should be able to see other people's stuff by default. It's nice for us to be able to learn from one another. It's harder to rely on the honor system for privacy nowadays, but I still think \"share by default\" is a noble ideal.That said, I also am unsure how best to overlap aliases and configs that are sensitive to my workplace with my everywhere config. Maybe I should have a .employer file that I source if it's there, but something about including that into my everywhere config feels decidedly not righteous.",

Otherwise they become a prison that forces you to install all your special versions and plugins and scripts and etc. on the other hand, I felt like making my dotfiles easy to share forced me to use as many default settings as possible, which in the long run saves me a lot of time and energy.“The only zen you’ll find on a mountain top is the zen you brought with you” is one of my favorite sayings, and in a weird way I find it fitting here.

In doing so you are telling everyone you allow any internet rando to have remote code execution rights on your computer. To me that is like boldly saying you like privacy in the same breath as saying you never lock your front door or close your drapes.Those package managers operate like Wikipedia where anyone can push whatever they want without signatures or vetting from poorly secured accounts without phishing-resistant 2FA etc.At that point you already allow anyone capable of creating a few useful PRs to Homebrew, basic phishing, or sim swapping the ability to see and publish anything on your computer, so your dotfiles being public should be the least of your concerns.Now you are probably thinking \"There is no way tools that every smart person I know uses could be that wildly insecure\"Ask yourself if those same people have experience exposing and exploiting supply chain attacks. We all have blind spots, and almost everyone has a massive blind spot here and my team and I have exploited it many times in audits.All said though, I personally publish my dotfiles because I am confident they are of more use to me and others public, and do not reveal anything useful to someone targeting me other than that I use some kind of Linux distro and neovim.Any sensitive work I do is in offline stateless virtual machines deterministically built from a supply chain with high accountability and I do not use any dotfiles in those environments.With good separation of concerns between yolo systems and hardened trusted systems, publishing information about either is perfectly fine. Almost no one has that kind of workflow separation though, usually accessing prod from their compromised dev macbooks.",
