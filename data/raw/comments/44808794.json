After a few weeks without an answer, I had assumed they chose other applicants.I've mostly stopped applying to the big companies long time ago (10+ years) precisely because I'd never hear back regardless of the match or the credentials.The only exception has been JaneStreet — they've contacted me almost immediately after a cold application with a small cover letter about my interests.Yet going the referral route, it's relatively easy to get an interview almost anywhere, even Google or Apple.",
