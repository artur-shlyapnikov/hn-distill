I won't use push notifications or PassKeys, because each requires that the server store information that can be linked to a user. We do require a valid email account, and that's it. The email account can be a throwaway, but it needs to be able to receive email. Other than that, the user can choose to do things like mention their location (even then, we \"fuzz it,\" at the server level), and maybe a couple of strings that can be anything they want.Even with that, I still find that I need to constantly assuage doubts.I know that not taking information is heresy, hereabouts, but, if I don't have it, it can't be leaked, and I can't be compelled to divulge it.",

Gold, for instance.On the other hand there is plenty of fraud in materials. There are different grades of stainless steel and different methods of production that yield differing qualities.Maybe “immutable, buyer-verifiable” would be stronger? Once you buy and own and verify the gold you bought, it can’t be retroactively degraded by the seller. But at the time of purchase, it’s not at all a sure thing.",

Ango and team seem to have genuine integrity.Am moving to Emacs, org, plus self-built elements, however. With much pain.You see, what is /not/ self-guaranteeing about a full Obsidian life-organising workflow is the necessary reliance on plugins and their quirky configs. I felt as locked in to the ecosystem as I ever did with services that ‘merely’ used a proprietary storage format.I know others in the same boat. Obsidian’s long-term legacy may well be primarily as a market-maker for Emacs.",

Potentially useful data (behavior, spending), which I don't want to touch with 10ft pole.Instead, I keep all the data local (user's device). No registration at all. Nothing to store on the server.Slightly more inconvenient for the users (to move to a new device, you need to export and import the local db), but cheaper and zero-stress for me.",
