The IPv6 fan community (e.g on reddit and other forums ) needs to accept a dual-stack world and the doubling of complexity required to operate that way.

That will be the only successful path to ipv6 adoption.Sure ipv6 has some better features, but dual-stack means you are doubling all of your config (ACLs, naming, firewalls, routing) test cases and vulnerability surface.  Moreover, ipv6 is not as intuitive.Shaming people into ipv6 will never work.  More effort should be invested into best practices, patterns, migration guides, support communities & more to assist in operating in a dual-stack environment for the foreseeable future.Pure ipv6 will never happen because the weak link breaks the chain.

Generally speaking, the IPs of your LAN are based on the prefix assigned by the ISP. Most residential ISPs don't offer static prefixes. This means that every time your prefix changes, the IPs of all your devices on your LAN change. Seems like this \"feature\" was developed in a more idealistic era when people probably thought everyone would be getting static IPv6 addresses, since shortages would never be an issue. Unfortuantely, they failed to foresee the fact that most major ISPs are terrible, greedy organizations that either outright refuse to offer static assignments, or continue treating them as if they were scarce IPv4 resources, charging a premium or requiring business-class service to even get them.2. The ISPs that do support v6, like Comcast/Xfinity in the USA, are only allocating one /64 prefix. This means you can only have one subnet (VLAN) on your LAN! Why are they being so stingy?I would love to migrate to IPv6, but these two issues alone make it feel like a clown show for home users.",
