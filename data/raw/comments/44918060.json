I don't think 10ms worth of timing obfuscation gets you very much though.> This temporal obfuscation prevents timing correlation attacksThis is a false statement. It makes correlation harder but correlation is a statistical relationship. The correlations are still there.(latter quotes are from their github readme https://github.com/vpdotnet/vpnetd-sgx )All that said, it is better to use SGX than to not use SGX, and it is better to use timing obfuscation than to not.

    "textPlain": "Intel SGX/remote attestation for verifying that servers are running the code they say they are running is very interesting, I believe Signal talked about doing something similar for contact discovery, but at a base level it requires a lot of trust. How do I verify that the attestation I receive back is the one of the machine I am contacting? Can I know for sure that this isn't a compromised SGX configuration, since the system has been broken in the past? Furthermore, can I really be sure that I can trust SGX attestations if I can't actually verify SGX itself? Even if the code running under SGX is verifiable, as an ordinary user it's basically impossible to tell if there are bugs that would make it possible to compromise.Personally I like the direction Mullvad went instead. I get that it means we really can't verify Mullvad's claims, but even in the event they're lying, at least we got some cool Coreboot ports out of it.If you're really paranoid, neither this service nor Mullvad offers that much assurance. I like the idea of verifiability, but I believe the type of people who want it are looking to satisfy deeper paranoia than can be answered with just trusting Intel... Still, more VPN options that try to take privacy claims seriously is nothing to complain about.",

A VPN that doesn’t accept Monero forces users into surveillance finance, since card and bank payments are legally preserved forever by processors.

Bit worried about the owners here; rasengan doesn't have a stellar reputation after what happened with Freenode.The idea itself is sound: if there are no SGX bypasses (hardware keys dumped, enclaves violated, CPU bugs exploited, etc.), and the SGX code is sound (doesn't leak the private keys by writing them to any non-confidential storage, isn't vulnerable to timing-based attacks, etc.), and you get a valid, up-to-date attestation containing the public key that you're encrypting your traffic with plus a hash of a trustworthy version of the SGX code, then you can trust that your traffic is indeed being decrypted inside an SGX enclave which has exclusive access to the private key.Obviously, that's a lot of conditions. Happily, you can largely verify those conditions given what's provided here; you can check that the attestation points to a CPU and configuration new enough to not have any (known) SGX breaks; you can check that the SGX code is sound and builds to the provided hash (exercise left to the reader); and you can check the attestation itself as it is signed with hardware keys that chain up to an Intel root-of-trust.However! An SGX enclave cannot interface with the system beyond simple shared memory input/output. In particular, an SGX enclave is not (and cannot be) responsible for socket communication; that must be handled by an OS that lies outside the SGX TCB (Trusted Computing Base). For typical SGX use-cases, this is OK; the data is what is secret, and the socket destinations are not.For a VPN, this is not true! The OS can happily log anything it wants! There's nothing stopping it from logging all the data going into and out of the SGX enclave and performing traffic correlation. Even with traffic mixing, there's nothing stopping the operators from sticking a single user onto their own, dedicated SGX enclave which is closely monitored; traffic mixing means nothing if its just a single user's traffic being mixed.So, while the use of SGX here is a n",

Also, I was handed it because Christel felt I was a good custodian thereof. Instead, former staff who I protected from allegations made by OldCoder for years, went on to form Libera, tried to steal the domain for a developers irc network when they themselves shockingly couldn’t even code a simple irc client, and then made up a false narrative.The state of open source generally isn’t what you think and you would do well for yourself to read Lunduke’s Journal among other things.
