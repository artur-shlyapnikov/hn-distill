They can't even get a simple safety benchmark working on lm_eval-harness. They're great at lecturing you why they shouldn't need that.And this is the key issue with AI Ethics. It's the refusal to work at the problem constructively, and get the most skilled people possible to actually make the damn benchmarks to work, to rank models on the understanding of human rights, to list every current violation and abuse of humans in every single country without exception and to make practical plans on what to do when systems go rogue. Even if they're not technical they could be making the dataset in a csv in excel for that and making it public domain accessible.Instead we get the most depressed, leechy-office-worker types complaining about how it's all over.Now back to work, move it.",

It’s also free publicity since the press eats that stuff up.But this also isn't where they are spending their time or effort! This article somehow didn't even get to the point of calling out what they are actually wasting time on: trying to get the model to not help people do things that are bad PR; this is a related access to trying to obtain good PR, but causes very different (and almost universally terrible) results.At least if they were truly actually spending time making sure the model doesn't go rogue and kill everyone, or try to take over the world, that could possibly be positive or even important (though I think is likely itself immoral in a different way, assuming it is even possible, which I don't, really... not unless you just make it not intelligent).But what they are instead doing is even worse than what this article is claiming: they are just wasting time making it so you can't have the AI make up a sexy story (oh the humanity), or teach you enough physics/chemistry to make bombs/drugs... things people not only can and already trivially do or learn without AI, but things they have failed to prevent every single time they release a new model--the \"jailbreak\" prompts may look a bit more silly, but you still get the result!--so why are they bothering?And, if that weren't enough, in the process, this is going to make the models LESS SAFE. The thing I think most people actually don't want is their model freaking out and trying to \"whistleblow\" on them to the authorities or their coworkers/friends... but that's in the same personality direction as trying to say \"I'm smarter than you and am not going to let you ask me that question as you might do something wrong with it\".The first and primary goal of AI ethics should be that the model does what",

What happens with the humans running the models? Their influx of power and resources? How will they hurt or harm society?This is just not my experience at all. People do worry about how models act because they infer that eventually they will be used as source of truth and because they already get used as source of action. People worry about racial makeup in certain historical contexts[1], people worry when Grok starts spouting Nazi stuff (hopefuly I don't need a citation for that one) because they take it as a sign of bias in a system with real world impact, that if ChatGPT happens to doubt the holocaust tomorrow, when little Jimmy asks it for help in an essay he will find a whole lot of white supremacist propaganda.

    "textPlain": "You put the finger on the sore spot. When people talk about ethics, you have to question which moral agenda they are pushing. The two topics are hard to separate. And kind of subjective. And only partially codified in law. Ethics seems to be about going above and beyond the letter of the law, usually for moralistic reasons.And when we talk about laws, we have to look internationally as well because they are not the same everywhere. And typically inspired by different value systems. Is it ethical for a Chinese police officer to use Chinese LLM to police Chinese citizens? I don't know. I'm a bit fuzzy on Confucius here which I assume would drive their thinking. And it might be an interesting perspective for Californian wannabe ethicists to consider that not all the values and morals that they are pushing are necessarily that widely shared and agreed upon.Also, there's a practical angle here because the Chinese seem to be very eager adopters of AI and don't appear to be particularly concerned about what anyone outside China thinks about that. That cat is out of the bag.I've always looked at ethicists with some skepticism. The reality with moralism (which drives ethics) is that it's about groups of people telling other people what to do, not do, how to behave, etc. This can quickly get preachy, political, and sometimes violent.A lot of this stuff can also be pragmatic. Most religions share a lot of moral principles. I'm not religious but I can see how going around killing and stealing is not a nice thing to have and that seems to be uncontroversial in many places. Never mind that some moralists extremists seem to be endlessly creative about coming up with ways to justify doing those two things.The pragmatic thing here is that the cat is already out of the bag and we might want to think about how we can adapt to that notion rather than to argue with the cat to please go back in the bag.",

Those with profit incentives to do so will create as many problems for society as they can.None of it is merely a distraction, we just don't have the capacity to defend against all of it.It is fair to say we might be practically better off focusing on one form of attack and sacrificing defense against another, but the only way to actually be safe is to stop your enemy from attacking at all. Either we shut down breakneck AI development (nearly impossible and guaranteed to have its own bad outcomes) or we slide rapidly into a more and more dangerous world.",
