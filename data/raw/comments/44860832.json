    "textPlain": "I wonder whether there are clock generators with on-chip temperature sensing...Yes: \"an advanced, low-power, high-performance mobile clock generator with four clock outputs. The device integrates a MEMS resonator, temperature sensor and a temperature-to-digital converter (TDC), which eliminates the need for external crystal and temperature-sensing crystal resonators.\" -- https://www.sitime.com/products/clock-generators/clock-gener...",

All gPTP implementations are required to compensate for link delay (not necessarily rx/tx asymmetry).",

You can get PCIe cards that have these on them, and devices for audio studios with a rubidium oscillator like the Tascam CG-1800.Jane Street has a podcast that lifts the veil a little bit on how they keep their gear synced up, which is pretty interesting: https://signalsandthreads.com/clock-synchronization/",
