The device integrates a MEMS resonator, temperature sensor and a temperature-to-digital converter (TDC), which eliminates the need for external crystal and temperature-sensing crystal resonators.\" -- https://www.sitime.com/products/clock-generators/clock-gener...",

All gPTP implementations are required to compensate for link delay (not necessarily rx/tx asymmetry).",
