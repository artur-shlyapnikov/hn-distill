    "textPlain": "A¬†good place to start is Cornelis Agrippa‚Äôs ‚ÄúThree Books on Occult Philosophy.‚Äù Agrippa was a lawyer and esoteric feminist (eg, he wrote ‚Äúon the nobility and preeminence of the female sex‚Äù) and defended women accused of witchcraft throughout Europe. His ‚Äúthree books‚Äù gave birth to the ‚Äúoccult‚Äù nomenclature.Or my favorite, Marsilio Ficino. There is a statue to Ficino when you walk into the library. Ficino was hired by Cosimo Medici (the Florentine who invented banking and funded much of the Florentine renaissance) to translate Plato and other esoteric books coming from the fall of Constantinople. He published ‚ÄúDe Mysteriis‚Äù in 1497, which paraphrases neoplatonic understanding of Gods, Demons, Heroes and Soul ‚Äî arguing that gods and demons don‚Äôt feel ‚Äî indeed, not even the soul (‚Äúthe lowest of the divines‚Äù) has any part that feels.(Aside: This idea was actually referenced in ‚ÄúK Pop Demon Hunters,‚Äù where they debate whether demons can feel ‚Äî or are ‚Äúall feelings‚Äù)It is an old Pythagorean tradition that sensation or consciousness arises out of the interaction of the immaterial soul and the material body. That ‚Äúthree world‚Äù idea is echoed by Nobel Laureate Roger Penrose in his book ‚ÄúRoad to Reality.‚Äù He talks about how the material world produces the world of consciousness which produces the world of ideas (including mathematics), which seems to produce the material world‚Ä¶In any case, there are many old ideas and nuggets of wisdom that have yet to be mined and discovered‚Äî don‚Äôt think for a moment that scholars have read all these books! We might need AI for that‚Ä¶",

    "textPlain": "I¬†love the art aesthetic of occult texts, but browsing through all these books just to find any hidden gems or interesting artwork seems really tedious. At least browsing through the list with the title pages visible shows a few interesting designs. Can't really get much more out of this because most of the texts are unreadable to me. This might be a good use case for agentic AI, to browse through the books and highlight any artwork that's hidden beyond the first page.For alchemy, I was recently learning about alchemical symbols and sigils, but quickly found out that pretty much all the interesting material from this era and category has been preserved, while all the ugly or uninteresting variants tend to get dropped. Unicode has a category for alchemical symbols and they just preserved what seems to be the best parts. Shout-out to U+1F756, the Alchemical Symbol for Horse Dung üùñ.Whenever I visit a major news publication with dedicated artists handling the creation of hero images, I often end up taking a bit of time to contemplate each design decision and exploring any symbolic interpretation. The best publications have a way of perfectly communicating the underlying tone and message of an article just from the hero image. The Atlantic tends to have the most creative hero images, while The Economist has the most interesting cover designs. And yet, despite this expertise, I never see people remark on those little delights, which in a way makes it occult while hiding in plain sight. It feels a bit connected, seeing the artwork in the first page of these books; maybe an invitation with the whispers of the kind of message the authors wished to convey.",
