I only feel sad for him.But if you think about it, I actually feel sad for myself. If I were in Woz's position with ~$20m or so and had missed the Apple cash cow (assuming $500m at the very least), how would I react? Would I live my entire life with regret and remorse? Would I be bitter?Huge props to Woz for figuring out what makes him happy and doing exactly that.",
