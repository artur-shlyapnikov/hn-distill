I was pitching investors for funding and had no idea what I was doing.He gave me some quick feedback that made a world of difference in SF (years later, when I tried raising angel money): get closer to people first. You don’t have to be their friends - just show up to where they show up (bars, meetups, library - anything), then tell them what you’re doing, and they’ll write you checks without you asking.This is still the key reason why raising money in the Bay Area is so much easier than anywhere else.I didn’t get any check from him that night, but he came across as such a human person - like someone you know for years - even to a complete stranger trying to go straight for his wallet.Tech would be amazing if we had 1000x more Wozes around.",
