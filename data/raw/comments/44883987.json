The pen was being demoed.The interface is flexible but probably want to have some interface presets out of the box.Edited:From the ui I couldn't tell it was a special build for ipad.Content and extensions are currently hard coded.",

    "textPlain": "I use it for real work, but it’s not the only device I use for work.  However it fits a pretty specific work niche for me.  With instant on and built in cellular with a Logitech folio case, it’s a hyper portable, yet comfortable to use fast and powerful device that allows me to do about 80% of work needs practically anywhere I can get a decent cellular signal.  So for me if I need to be away from my desk for any reason, but stay connected its nearly like I am right in my office.",

    "textPlain": "generally, I agree with you on this matter. However, I can see a real user case for this when texturing an object. In fact I believe that the Blender Foundation would be better of dedicating the entire app to this purpose. Currently, texture painting in Blender is a royal PITA. A dedicated iPad texturing app that seamlessly integrates to Blender would be a very exciting prospect.",
