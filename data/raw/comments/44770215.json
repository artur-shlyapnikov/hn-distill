Knowing him, that's definitely not true, heh. Did all kinds of mostly harmless stuff. Like returned bottles for a deposit, waited until the clerk put them out back, went to fetch them and deposited them again, until getting caught.",

    "textPlain": "> There’s an old apartment building in South Minneapolis that looks totally out of place. It’s in a residential neighborhood with small bungalows and some auto body shops. And in the early 1900s, it used to be part of an amusement park called Wonderland. The park’s biggest attraction wasn’t the roller coaster, or the dance hall, or the log flume. It was a sideshow called “the Infantorium.” Visitors would pay ten cents to enter a spacious room full of glass boxes that were incubators with tiny premature babies on display. But despite how weird this whole concept might seem today, this wasn’t the only place this was happening.99% Invisible Podcast: [0]The Infantorium0: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-infantorium/",

Might as well declare all self-taught programmers as useless when it's clear they're a massive benefit.",
