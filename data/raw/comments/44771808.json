When I worked at a company that did a lot of M&A I was sitting around like, \"Why couldn't you have just built that?\" When I worked at a company that was recently acquired and went through the merger process I was like, \"wow I see why you bozos would've never built this yourselves.\" That isn't to say there aren't companies that do them well or there aren't places where it makes sense in an ultra-competitive landscape but I'm curious - when was the last time anyone really considered tech an ultra competitive landscape?Post-2015 other than large language models this industry has mostly been riding on intellectual property consolidation. That's basically Lina's point; nobody actually benefits from this - not customers, not share holders, not the American people.

If you are acquired by a much larger company, that company will have to pay a (logarithmicaly) large fee relative to the acquisition price.

For example, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told Business Insider, “Figma is a massive success, but it’s because of the company’s innovative growth and not due to the FTC and [Khan].”That would be a great point if there were any indication at all that’s what Khan was implying. It’s either an intentionally disingenuous reading of her statements, or else an unintentionally dim comprehension of them…from an analyst…It’s also not a great sign that Business Insider thought this was the best way to end this article. At the very least, how about interrogating whether or not their “innovative growth” might have something to do with how healthy regulatory systems might work to facilitate such things? Or whether that innovative growth could have continued apace under Adobe’s management?I suppose I am being too credulous, and it’s more likely the same widely shared ideological bent that celebrates free market dynamism with each success, and decries oppressive regulations with each misstep. A culture that sees virtue in offshoring profits while simultaneously using them to eliminate competition, erode consumer protections, lobby for preferential tax credits, and generally skirt any/all obligations to the society which provided them with the opportunities, infrastructure, finance markets, skilled workforce, and well-qualified consumers that are all prerequisites to “innovative growth”.",

The market cap after 90 days of trading (generally speaking when insiders lock-up provisions expire and there is no longer a limit on the number of shares that can be sold) is a much better estimate of the actual value of the company. We don't have that yet, but right now the stock is ~3x the valuation that Adobe was going to buy at. Every equity owner is currently booking this as a win. We'll see what the price is when the lock-out provisions end, but right now definitely the shareholders are glad that they didn't merge.I know that because if the metric you cite was something that the investors and managers cared about, they could have done other things to boost it (see footnote 1). They didn't, ergo they don't consider that metric to be a useful gauge of the company value. It sure looks like you tried to find the worst performing metric to claim that there was a loss, when so far this has been a major win for the shareholders(2).1: If you don't want this and want to IPO at the highest valuation, you do a direct listing like Spotify did, or a SPAC reverse merger like Trump Media did. But there are reasons that the vast majority of companies choose to do a traditional IPO. For most companies, this is a one-time transaction that will make the managers very very rich, and they want to get the best guidance on navigating it- and are willing to pay handsomely for that guidance, since this is the only time in their lives they will be CEO for a major company that is starting to list. So they follow the IPO/greenshoes/pop route.2: The most important nuance on that statement is that it took them a year and a half to extract that extra value by doing an IPO, and now they are exposed to market risk.
