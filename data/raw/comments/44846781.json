Offload rendering each time slice frame to worker threads.I'm surprised Bezier-rs is all about curves. Sure, fonts, but I can't be alone here in seeing curves as a special case.It's easy as a pure mathematician to write off Bezier theory as \"specialized\" but it's simply the right way to work with polynomials on a simplex.",
