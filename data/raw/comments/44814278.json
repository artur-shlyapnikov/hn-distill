But I think it is a perfectly valid choice by the developer, and users can choose whether or not they think it is worth it or use a competitor that doesn't (or a competitor is created that doesn't).But the issue of laws requiring it I think is where things have gone too far. So much of this is being framed as \"protect the children\" but most of it really seems to be fueled from a puritanical \"porn is bad\" and needing to make it harder to get access too for adults. I really wish we could move past this as a society, stop vilifying it, being ashamed of sex, etc.And likely throw in some tracking of what people are doing online since now you no longer have the anonymity.Edit:If you really truly are trying to \"protect the children\"...
