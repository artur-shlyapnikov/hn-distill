    "textPlain": "\"OpenAI was plugging Claude into its own internal tools using special developer access (APIs)\"Unless it's actually some internal Claude API which OpenAI were using with an OpenAI benchmarking tool, this sounds like a hyped-up way for Wired to phrase it.Almost like: `Woah man, OpenAI HACKED Claude's own AI mainframe until Sonnet slammed down the firewall man!` ;D\nSeriously though, why phrase API use of Claude as \"special developer access\"?I suppose that it's reasonable to disagree on what is reasonable for safety benchmarking, e.g: where you draw a line and say, \"hey, that's stealing\" vs \"they were able to find safety weak spots in their model\". I wonder what the best labs are like at efficiently hunting for weak areas!Funnily enough I think Anthropic have banned a lot of people from their API, myself included - and all I did was see if it could read a letter I got, and they never responded to my query to sort it out! But what does it matter if people can just use OpenRouter?",

Either openai were trying to see their product works better than Claude code (each with their own proprietary models) on certain benchmarks and that is something Anthropic revoked. How they caught it is far more remarkable. It's one thing to use sonnet 4 to solve a problem on Livebench, its slightly different to do it via the harness where Anthropic never published any results themselves. Not saying this is a right stance, but this seems to be the stance.",
