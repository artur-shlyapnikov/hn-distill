Ok, yeah, that's not really relevant to the point the article was actually getting to, but I think it's important to remember. There's nothing magical about those colors. They  effectively stimulate color receptors in our eyes such that our brains interpret the input in ways that can be combined to cover a pretty large gamut of the full range our eyes can perceive.But as for what the article actually does focus on, I absolutely agree. You can create some really striking art by restricting your gamut to the range you can cover with a particular set of pigments.",

As a result, trying to teach cyan and magenta as primary colors will be much harder than teaching blue and red as primary colors.For more on basic color terms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term#Basic_color_terms",
