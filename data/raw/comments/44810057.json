Ok, yeah, that's not really relevant to the point the article was actually getting to, but I think it's important to remember. There's nothing magical about those colors. They  effectively stimulate color receptors in our eyes such that our brains interpret the input in ways that can be combined to cover a pretty large gamut of the full range our eyes can perceive.But as for what the article actually does focus on, I absolutely agree. You can create some really striking art by restricting your gamut to the range you can cover with a particular set of pigments.",

    "textPlain": "One of the things I love about “Contact” is that the contact mechanism chosen by the aliens was so close to what I guessed aliens would use when I first learned about SETI.Decimal is not universal. Not seconds, not meters, not sound frequencies used for communication, not colors. Our sky isn’t blue, it’s purple. Ask any bee and they’ll tell you. But hydrogen glows at very specific colors and that only changes if you are moving fast enough.The fundamental colors are the colors of the elements and, I might argue, their oxides. As reflected by light or when they incandesce. Gold. Rust. Arsenic green. Carbon black.  Maybe the emission bands of noble gases, though those are hardly every day items.(If I were a very clever alien though, and I discovered exotic states of matter where the elements behaved differently, and I only wanted to talk to other very clever aliens, I might use those instead to talk over the heads of the younger or dumber species, which is why I stopped contributing to SETI. We are looking under the wrong rocks, IMO).",

    "textPlain": "I think that understanding how eyes and light work is very informative on this subject.Why are there 3 primary colors (regardless of which 3 you pick)? That has nothing to do with the nature of light, and everything to do with the fact that humans see light using 3 distinct frequency response curves [0]. This means that humans perceive color as a 3 dimensional space; and the role of the primary colors is to pick a point in this space by selectively stimulating or masking the 3 response curves. In a world of pure linear algebra, almost any 3 colors would do, but physical reality limits how ideally we can mix them; and how much light they can emit/mask.Further, the 3 response curves are overlapping, so there is no set of ideal colors that would let you actually control the 3 curves independently.[0] At least for color perception in a typical human.",

    "textPlain": "While you are right, \"magenta\" is just a fancy synonym for \"purple\". It might have been chosen instead of \"purple\" because the traditional word could be applied to colors having various proportions of red and blue, while \"magenta\" is intended to convey that the amounts of red and blue are equal. However all the traditional color names, like \"red\", \"green\" or \"blue\" refer to wide ranges of hues, not to a precise hue, so there was really no good reason for the use of the word \"magenta\".\"Cyan\" is a very bad word choice caused by confusions in the translations of Ancient Greek texts made by philologists ignorant of chemistry and mineralogy. In Ancient Greek, \"cyan\" meant pure blue, not blue-green. More precisely, it was the color of the ultramarine blue pigment, the most expensive blue pigment at that time, which was imported from the present territory of Afghanistan and for which the name \"ku-wa-no\" was already used by the Hittites, a millennium before the Greeks. Nowadays ultramarine blue is still used as a pigment, but it is made synthetically, so its cost is a small fraction of what it was before the 19th century.Before the use of \"cyan\" has started, the color name \"blue-green\" had been used for a very long time. Similarly, \"orange\" is a relatively new English word, but the color had been mentioned for many centuries, as \"red-yellow\" or \"yellow-red\".So the awareness of distinct hues is not necessarily limited to the set of simple color words, because most languages have used compound words to name the hues for which they did not have a simple word.Other languages have used the names of well-known colored objects to distinguish the hues that did not have distinct names. For instance, in Latin the word for \"red\" was used for both red colors and purple colors. When Latin speakers wanted to specify whether something was red or purple, they would say \"red like the kermes (red) dye\" or \"red like the purple dye\" (the word \"purple\" as a color name comes from the latter expr",
