    "textPlain": "This essay could probably benefit from some engagement with the literature on “interpretability” in LLMs, including the empirical results about how knowledge (like addition) is represented inside the neural network. To be blunt, I’m not sure being smart and reasoning from first principles after asking the LLM a lot of questions and cherry picking what it gets wrong gets to any novel insights at this point. And it already feels a little out date, with LLMs getting gold on the mathematical Olympiad they clearly have a pretty good world model of mathematics. I don’t think cherry-picking a failure to prove 2 + 2 = 4 in the particular specific way the writer wanted to see disproves that at all.LLMs have imperfect world models, sure. (So do humans.) That’s because they are trained to be generalists and because their internal representations of things are massively compressed single they don’t have enough weights to encode everything. I don’t think this means there are some natural limits to what they can do.",

    "textPlain": "That whole bit about color blending and transparency and LLMs \"not knowing colors\" is hard to believe. I am literally using LLMs every day to write image-processing and computer vision code using OpenCV. It seamlessly reasons across a range of concepts like color spaces, resolution, compression artifacts, filtering, segmentation and human perception. I mean, removing the alpha from a PNG image was a preprocessing step it wrote by itself as part of a larger task I had given it, so it certainly understands transparency.I even often describe the results e.g. \"this fails when in X manner when the image has grainy regions\" and it figures out what is going on, and adapts the code accordingly. (It works with uploading actual images too, but those consume a lot of tokens!)And all this in a rather niche domain that seems relatively less explored. The images I'm working with are rather small and low-resolution, which most literature does not seem to contemplate much. It uses standard techniques well known in the art, but it adapts and combines them well to suit my particular requirements. So they seem to handle \"novel\" pretty well too.If it can reason about images and vision and write working code for niche problems I throw at it, whether it \"knows\" colors in the human sense is a purely philosophical question.",

    "textPlain": "Here's what LLMs remind me of.When I went to uni, we had tutorials several times a week. Two students, one professor, going over whatever was being studied that week. The professor would ask insightful questions, and the students would try to answer.Sometimes, I would answer a question correctly without actually understanding what I was saying. I would be spewing out something that I had read somewhere in the huge pile of books, and it would be a sentence, with certain special words in it, that the professor would accept as an answer.But I would sometimes have this weird feeling of \"hmm I actually don't get it\" regardless. This is kinda what the tutorial is for, though. With a bit more prodding, the prof will ask something that you genuinely cannot produce a suitable word salad for, and you would be found out.In math-type tutorials it would be things like realizing some equation was useful for finding an answer without having a clue about what the equation actually represented.In economics tutorials it would be spewing out words about inflation or growth or some particular author but then having nothing to back up the intuition.This is what I suspect LLMs do. They can often be very useful to someone who actually has the models in their minds, but not the data to hand. You may have forgotten the supporting evidence for some position, or you might have missed some piece of the argument due to imperfect memory. In these cases, LLM is fantastic as it just glues together plausible related words for you to examine.The wheels come off when you're not an expert. Everything it says will sound plausible. When you challenge it, it just apologizes and pretends to correct itself.",

It's okay to reject it, but you should know that not many people do (even some non-orthodox thoughts by Penrose about the brain not being simulatable by an ordinary digital computer still accept that some physical machine - the brain - is able to represent what we're interested in).> If we accept the incompleteness theoremThere is no if there. It's a theorem. But it's completely irrelevant. It means that there are mathematical propositions that can't be proven or disproven by some system of logic, i.e. by some mechanical means. But if something is in the universe, then it's already been proven by some mechanical process: the mechanics of nature. That means that if some finite set of symbols could represent the laws of nature, then anything in nature can be proven in that logical system.\nWhich brings us back to the first point: the only way the mechanics of nature cannot be represented by symbols is if they are somehow infinite, i.e. they don't follow some finite set of laws. In other words - there is no physics. Now, that may be true, but if that's the case, then AI is the least of our worries.Of course, if physics does exist - i.e. the universe is governed by a finite set of laws - that doesn't mean that we can predict the future, as that would entail both measuring things precisely and simulating them fast",

Given how often people attempt to apply them to situations where they don’t say anything of note, I think the default should generally be to not publicly appeal to them unless one either has worked out semi-carefully how to derive the thing one wants to show from them, or at least have a sketch that one is confident, from prior experience working with it, that one could make into a rigorous argument. Absent these, the most one should say, I think, is “Perhaps one can use Gödel’s incompleteness theorems to show [thing one wants to show].” .Now, given a program that is supposed to output text that encodes true statements (in some language), one can probably define some sort of inference system that corresponds to the program such that the inference system is considered to “prove” any sentence that the program outputs (and maybe also some others based on some logical principles, to ensure that the inference system satisfies some good properties), and upon defining this, one could (assuming the language allows making the right kinds of statements about arithmetic) show that this inference system is, by Gödel’s theorems, either inconsistent or incomplete.This wouldn’t mean that the language was unable to express those statements. It would mean that the program either wouldn’t output those statements, or that the system constructed from the program was inconsistent (and, depending on how the inference system is obtained from the program, the inference system being inconsistent would likely imply that the program sometimes outputs false or contradictory statements).But, this has basically nothing to do with the “placeholders” thing you said.  Gödel’s theorem doesn’t say that some propositions are inexpressible in a given language, but that some propositions can’t be proven in certain axiom+inference systems.Rather than the incompleteness theorems, the “undefinability of truth” result seems more relevant to ",

The context windows are more than large enough to remember 10 moves. The model should either track the pieces, or mention that it would be playing blindfold chess absent a board to look at and it isn't good at this, so could you please list the position after every move to make it fair, or it doesn't know what it's doing; it's demonstrably the latter.",
