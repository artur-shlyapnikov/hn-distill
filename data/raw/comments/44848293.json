The trick is that the 386 provides four Byte Enable outputs (BE0#-BE3#) that indicates which bytes in the word are being transferred. Of course, it's not that simple. If the lower 16 bits of the data bus aren't being used, the upper 16 bits of the data bus are duplicated on the lower 16 bits to make 16-bit buses more efficient (somehow).",
