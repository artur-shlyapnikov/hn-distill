    "textPlain": "Hey @kens, congrats on the page! Extremely super small usability note/suggestion: if you changed your inputs (above the tool that lets you see all of the layers) to something like this:    <input name=\"layer\" type=\"radio\" onclick=\"show('https://static.righto.com/images/386-package/layer0.jpg')\" id=\"layer1\">\n    <label for=\"layer1\">Pins</label>\n\nthen it would be possible to click the label name (i.e. Pins, I/O Vcc, etc.) instead of having to click the small radio circles.It's a small thing, but I think it's a lot more fun/easy/fast to click the different label names rather than the circles. It's truly a small nit - just in case it's an easy fix for you. Cheers!(just to make sure: you need to add a unique \"id\" attribute for each \"input\", and then make a <label> tag for each label referencing that id in the \"for\")",

    "textPlain": "Since the 386 is a 32-bit processor, the address specifies a 32-bit word and doesn't use address bits A0 and A1. But what if you just want to read a byte or a 16-bit word? The trick is that the 386 provides four Byte Enable outputs (BE0#-BE3#) that indicates which bytes in the word are being transferred. Of course, it's not that simple. If the lower 16 bits of the data bus aren't being used, the upper 16 bits of the data bus are duplicated on the lower 16 bits to make 16-bit buses more efficient (somehow).",
