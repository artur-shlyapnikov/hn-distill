The 33MHz was the bomb, but of course that cost more bones $$$$.  The computer fairs were cool.",

Extremely super small usability note/suggestion: if you changed your inputs (above the tool that lets you see all of the layers) to something like this:    <input name=\"layer\" type=\"radio\" onclick=\"show('https://static.righto.com/images/386-package/layer0.jpg')\" id=\"layer1\">\n    <label for=\"layer1\">Pins</label>\n\nthen it would be possible to click the label name (i.e. Pins, I/O Vcc, etc.) instead of having to click the small radio circles.It's a small thing, but I think it's a lot more fun/easy/fast to click the different label names rather than the circles. It's truly a small nit - just in case it's an easy fix for you. Cheers!(just to make sure: you need to add a unique \"id\" attribute for each \"input\", and then make a <label> tag for each label referencing that id in the \"for\")",
