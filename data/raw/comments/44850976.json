    "textPlain": "An important side note is that Cooler Master’s “10-year Warranty” is garbage:> I looked at Cooler Master’s warranty, and for issues within the first two years you have to deal with the retailer. That would be Amazon in my case. So I looked at Amazon’s information on warranty issues. Their policy is that if it’s more than 30 days since purchase, you have to send it off to a third-party repair center and wait for them to diagnose and try to repair it. Here’s the kicker: Usually repairs take up to 20 business days (including delivery time), but could take slightly longerEveryone knows electronic devices tend to die early or last forever. Cooler Master and Amazon are working a shitty dodge here, and I bet they avoid most DOA warranty claims because of it.",

Peel off the label, remove the bung, pry out the circlip and pull the rotor + blade assembly out, clean off any remaining old grease/oil, and then pack the bushing with petroleum jelly before reinserting the shaft. Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.",

    "textPlain": "I am pretty certain that the G2 Noctua fans will start at 5V and they also in the 4 pin model will turn off at 0-19% and turn on at 20%. Its a bit of a shame Noctua don't make 2 pin fans anymore but it is possible on the latest most efficient models to get the low start voltage.The G1 Noctua fans don't, I have a 120mm still in my case that is a decade or so old and it starts at a bit under 7V, but all the G2 140mm will start at 5V IIRC the Noctua presentations on this. Wish it was laid out in the specifications however.",

Compared to the price of a modern gaming PC, that's nothing (also avoiding not risking your life).",

Can you throw that out for me?The confusion on the guy’s face was great.Spent more than enough time on the $100 microwave. Their problem now.",
