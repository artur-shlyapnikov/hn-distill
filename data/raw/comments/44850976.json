    "textPlain": "An important side note is that Cooler Master’s “10-year Warranty” is garbage:> I looked at Cooler Master’s warranty, and for issues within the first two years you have to deal with the retailer. That would be Amazon in my case. So I looked at Amazon’s information on warranty issues. Their policy is that if it’s more than 30 days since purchase, you have to send it off to a third-party repair center and wait for them to diagnose and try to repair it. Here’s the kicker: Usually repairs take up to 20 business days (including delivery time), but could take slightly longerEveryone knows electronic devices tend to die early or last forever. Cooler Master and Amazon are working a shitty dodge here, and I bet they avoid most DOA warranty claims because of it.",

Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.",

Its a bit of a shame Noctua don't make 2 pin fans anymore but it is possible on the latest most efficient models to get the low start voltage.The G1 Noctua fans don't, I have a 120mm still in my case that is a decade or so old and it starts at a bit under 7V, but all the G2 140mm will start at 5V IIRC the Noctua presentations on this. Wish it was laid out in the specifications however.",

Compared to the price of a modern gaming PC, that's nothing (also avoiding not risking your life).",

    "textPlain": "In Europe, it actually matches the law, it is actually better.- You have a 14 days retraction period, where you can send back the item and get your money back, defect or not. Amazon gives you 30 days and free return shipping.- Legal warranty is 2 years and is provided by the seller, not the manufacturer. It is Amazon in this case, but it could be a brick and mortar shop or any other seller, including independent sellers. And they have to solve your problem within 30 days (repair, refund, replacement, ...). How to deal with the manufacturer is their problem. Amazon here is perfectly in line with the law.- Manufacturer warranty and commercial warranty comes in addition to the legal warranty is whatever is written in the contract.So here, the manufacturer doesn't need to provide warranty directly to the consumer for the first 2 years as the legal warranty covers it. And I am pretty sure that the 8 extra years offered by Cooler Master are even worse than what Amazon offers. For example, they may require you to pay for return shipping and wait even longer. There may be some fine print there too.",

    "textPlain": "Modern computer power supplies are far less dangerous than CRTs were.CRTs were dangerous because they used extremely high voltages (often as high as 25 kV), and that voltage was often present on the CRT itself, which acted as a capacitor. The capacitance of the CRT was relatively low, but it still stored enough energy to be very hazardous. There's ways to safely discharge them, but you absolutely need to know what you're doing and work with one hand behind your back.The voltages in a modern switching power supply are much lower (typically no more than ~1.5x line voltage ≈ 180V), and the capacitors usually have \"bleeder\" resistors which will discharge them to safe voltages within a few seconds. I'd still give one a few minutes before touching it - and maybe check one or two of the bigger capacitors with a multimeter - but it's still much less dangerous.",
