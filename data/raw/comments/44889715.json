    "textPlain": "Social media can be fixed, its just the incentives are not aligned.To make money, social media companies need people to stay on as long as possible. That means showing people sex, violence, rage and huge amounts of copyright infringements.There is little advantage in creating real-world consequences for bad actors. Why? because it hurts growth.There was a reason why the old TV networks didn't let any old twat with a camera broadcast stuff on their network, why? because they would get huge fines if they broke decency \"laws\" (yes america had/has censorship, hence why the simpsons say \"whoopee\" and \"snuggle\")There are few things that can cause company ending fines for social media companies. Which means we get almost no moderation.Until that changes, social media will be \"broken\"",

Think back to newsgroups, email lists, web forums. They were pretty much all chronological or maybe had a simple scoring or upvoting mechanism. You still had outrage, flamewars, and the guy who always had to have the last word. Social media engagement algorithms probably do amplify that but the dysfunction was always part of it.The only thing I've seen that works to reduce this is active moderation.",

Outlandish short posts, same lame jokes / pithy appeals to our emotions, and so on. People on there want to behave the same way they wanted to on Twitter.",

Thats all its doing. continual a/b to see if you like what ever flavour of bullshit is popular.Most people don't realise that you can banish posts from your feeds by doing a long press \"I don't like this\" equivalent. It takes a few times for the machine to work out if its an account, groups of accounts of theme that you don't like, and it'll stop showing it to you. (threads for example took a very long time to stop showing me fucking sports.)Why don't more people know this? because it hurts short term metrics for what ever bollocks the devs are working on. so its not that well advertised. just think how unsuccessful the experiments in the facebook app would have been if you were able to block the \"other posts we think you might like\" experiments. How sad Zuckerberg would be that his assertion was actually bollocks?",
