Here's a person who is not a travel industry veteran, but was curious about something, so they just started googling facts and figures, tried to find a trend, then looked for evidence to back up the trend they were looking for, then googled for \"explanations\" (read: news articles from mainstream media) to justify the trends they were looking for. At no time did they actually talk to somebody in the travel industry. Just a lot of googling, vague questions, and hand-wavey answers.The weirdest part is how subjective the question is. It's like saying, is life getting worse? It turns out there's more than a few ways of looking at that. Air travel is cheap and widely available, despite coming out of a global pandemic, not to mention the global recession before that, among other minor blips. Oh, but you were delayed in getting in your magic metal tube that hurtles through the sky at hundreds of miles an hour, letting you sip beer and watch movies in your PJs while traveling thousands of miles in a few hours, arriving safer than any other form of transportation? Man, that's terrible.",

    "textPlain": "I wonder how much of the increased schedule times are due to baggage fees?  Here is my theory:In 2008, airlines began charging for checked bags[1].  This was done both for the immediate revenue increase, and also to prod flyers into airline loyalty programs or airline credit cards to get a free checked bag.  However, that caused a lot of casual fliers to go carryon-only.  That, in turn, causes it to take longer to board/exit planes, leading to longer turn around times.I've long contended that airlines should get rid of checked bag fees.  And if they feel like they really want to be evil, switch the fees to carryons.  That would decrease the number of carryons and decrease the turnaround time.EDIT: From the article \"Starting around 2008, Scheduled flight times began increasing even faster than actual ones\"\nThis has me convinced that the bag fees really torpedoed turnaround times.[1] https://www.farecompare.com/travel-advice/airline-fees-bags-...",

I’ve flown about half a dozen trips.I also hate the argument that the free market should solve the pricing problem. Airlines have exclusivity on airport gates. Any frequent flier on the SFO -> EWR route knows that if you want to save money you can book an Alaska flight instead of United but Alaska has significantly fewer gates and usually gets delayed when arriving waiting for one. Flights aren’t exactly equal commodities and even if the airlines were well-run, contracts for these gates are locked in.Pricing stats here also fail to account for business class vs economy pricing. Business class prices on tickets have skyrocketed, way outstripping purported CPI. In some cases prices have doubled or more since COVID.",

They claimed that this was a known fact, whether you read left or right news sources, but when I did my research (not on bias, but on actual hiring results), it said that historically, the FAA has been about 90% white, and currently is about 70% white (IIRC), which is a far cry from suggesting that the FAA has race and gender quotas.Again, here, the article makes the same claim, but this time with a citation (!), so I wondered if there was some truth to it, that I missed, earlier, but again, the truth does not pan out.  It seems that a few members of the NBCFAE (National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees) stepped over the line in their attempts to to change hiring practices that were preventing black candidates from being considered (going from increasing the diversity of the candidate pool, which is laudable, to discriminating in order to change up the racial mix, which is illegal).However, in all of this, it's not the FAA acting, just a few powerful individuals from the NBCFAE.

Now just about anyone with disposable income can afford it.An economy ticket in the 90s was (roughly IIRC) equivalent to business class today in terms of service and first class in terms of price.Yes, it's a lot cheaper. IMO if someone wants to experience 90s style travel they could upgrade to business or first class but there's a reason why most people don't.Airlines have also gotten better at saving money on things that won't chase customers away. Delays are always a possibility so just having a better record on delays won't win many customers because they still need to manage the risk of delay.

    "textPlain": "Honestly I'd love to check bags more often, but it's too frequently an inordinately slow and risky proposition.I get free checked bags through my preferred airline's credit card, but still almost never do it because it adds so much time and frustration. The number of times I've had to wait an additional hour+ at baggage claim is ridiculous. And I've had bags lost/misrouted a stupid percentage of the time considering how infrequently I check bags. Fortunately never lost for good, but getting your bags days after you arrive is not great.Even airlines like Alaska that have their \"20 minute guarantee\" often exceed it but get away with it because to make a claim you have to wait in line at the understaffed baggage office, wasting even more time after late bags. Get real.If airlines/airports want to incentivize checking bags they need to do more than just make it free, but make it fast and reliable, too.",

Just about the only good thing about those airlines is that they are super dedicated to on-time operations and not wasting time. They can’t afford to waste any time when they’re offering $25 international flights.Of course, not having 9 boarding groups of various status levels helps a lot too.",

    "textPlain": "> I've long contended that airlines should get rid of checked bag fees.I agree, but I think another big incentive for people to bring carryons is how the airlines deal with checked baggage. All too often you have to wait forever to collect your bags, or your bag gets damaged, or your bag gets lost (usually not permanently).With checked bag fees, the airlines took one of the worst aspects of their own service and started charging more for it. And they wonder why nobody wants to check a bag.If airlines took checked bags seriously I'd check bags more often -- even if I had to pay to check them.",

    "textPlain": "Anecdotally, Southwest flights now take much longer to board because of the stupid checked luggage fee they just introduced.I’d pay $60 more per flight just to not have to deal with other people screwing with giant carry on bags, and the repeated announcements that there’s no room in the overhead compartments.As a bonus, they also set the sizes for checked luggage slightly below industry standards.  Good luck finding something close to but below their linear inch limit.  I figured this out because instead of checking three small bags, the family now checks one that’s right up to the weight + size limit.They used to be the best domestic airline (due to enshittification with all the other carriers), and also one of the cheapest.  They could have just raised ticket prices by $50 on average and still have been one of the cheapest.Instead of realizing they were the premium choice, they’re racing to become one of the worst airlines.  They even recently announced they’re going to charge extra for legroom early next year.I wonder how much it will cost them to move the seats around so some of them have inadequate legroom, and how many rows that’ll add.Anyway, yes, flights have gotten much worse in the last ten years.",

So that encourages airlines to nickel and dime later, such as by charging for bags and a million other things, making the whole experience worse.If the whole price had to be flat and bundled into the ticket the experience would be better.It's also an industry that competes on price, and that tends toward a spiral to the bottom in quality. They aren't allowed to skimp too much on safety stuff, and if they did it'd cost more in the long run, but they are incentivized to make seats tiny and uncomfortable and nickel and dime.",
