    "textPlain": "This is pretty funny. It's like a case study in the armchair expert. Here's a person who is not a travel industry veteran, but was curious about something, so they just started googling facts and figures, tried to find a trend, then looked for evidence to back up the trend they were looking for, then googled for \"explanations\" (read: news articles from mainstream media) to justify the trends they were looking for. At no time did they actually talk to somebody in the travel industry. Just a lot of googling, vague questions, and hand-wavey answers.The weirdest part is how subjective the question is. It's like saying, is life getting worse? It turns out there's more than a few ways of looking at that. Air travel is cheap and widely available, despite coming out of a global pandemic, not to mention the global recession before that, among other minor blips. Oh, but you were delayed in getting in your magic metal tube that hurtles through the sky at hundreds of miles an hour, letting you sip beer and watch movies in your PJs while traveling thousands of miles in a few hours, arriving safer than any other form of transportation? Man, that's terrible.",

    "textPlain": "I wonder how much of the increased schedule times are due to baggage fees?  Here is my theory:In 2008, airlines began charging for checked bags[1].  This was done both for the immediate revenue increase, and also to prod flyers into airline loyalty programs or airline credit cards to get a free checked bag.  However, that caused a lot of casual fliers to go carryon-only.  That, in turn, causes it to take longer to board/exit planes, leading to longer turn around times.I've long contended that airlines should get rid of checked bag fees.  And if they feel like they really want to be evil, switch the fees to carryons.  That would decrease the number of carryons and decrease the turnaround time.EDIT: From the article \"Starting around 2008, Scheduled flight times began increasing even faster than actual ones\"\nThis has me convinced that the bag fees really torpedoed turnaround times.[1] https://www.farecompare.com/travel-advice/airline-fees-bags-...",

I’ve flown about half a dozen trips.I also hate the argument that the free market should solve the pricing problem. Airlines have exclusivity on airport gates. Any frequent flier on the SFO -> EWR route knows that if you want to save money you can book an Alaska flight instead of United but Alaska has significantly fewer gates and usually gets delayed when arriving waiting for one. Flights aren’t exactly equal commodities and even if the airlines were well-run, contracts for these gates are locked in.Pricing stats here also fail to account for business class vs economy pricing. Business class prices on tickets have skyrocketed, way outstripping purported CPI. In some cases prices have doubled or more since COVID.",
