    "textPlain": "I wonder how much of the increased schedule times are due to baggage fees?  Here is my theory:In 2008, airlines began charging for checked bags[1].  This was done both for the immediate revenue increase, and also to prod flyers into airline loyalty programs or airline credit cards to get a free checked bag.  However, that caused a lot of casual fliers to go carryon-only.  That, in turn, causes it to take longer to board/exit planes, leading to longer turn around times.I've long contended that airlines should get rid of checked bag fees.  And if they feel like they really want to be evil, switch the fees to carryons.  That would decrease the number of carryons and decrease the turnaround time.[1] https://www.farecompare.com/travel-advice/airline-fees-bags-...",

    "textPlain": "In May, Newark airport flights were on time 49% of the time: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20...Maybe in aggregate flights have fewer delays but every single flight I’ve taken this year has been delayed (on top of the padded flight times the article mentions). I’ve flown about half a dozen trips.I also hate the argument that the free market should solve the pricing problem. Airlines have exclusivity on airport gates. Any frequent flier on the SFO -> EWR route knows that if you want to save money you can book an Alaska flight instead of United but Alaska has significantly fewer gates and usually gets delayed when arriving waiting for one. Flights aren’t exactly equal commodities and even if the airlines were well-run, contracts for these gates are locked in.Pricing stats here also fail to account for business class vs economy pricing. Business class prices on tickets have skyrocketed, way outstripping purported CPI. In some cases prices have doubled or more since COVID.",

Between 2021-2024 or so, I encountered a lot of people working for airlines (gate agents, flight attendants, etc.) who really went out of their way to make me feel like they're doing me a favor by letting me fly on their plane.That's not to say that the average airline worker is like that; it just seemed like the bottom fell out, so that the floor on what my worst experience could be while flying became substantially worse compared to times before.",
