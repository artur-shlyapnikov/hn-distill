    "textPlain": "Forget NetflixBetter idea --- forget Volkswagen.This is just one example of anti-consumer antics bordering on extortion that have been building for a very long time.The overall idea is simple --- reduce the sticker price to a competitive level and try to increase profits with prepaid maintenance, insurance, data collection and other \"subscription\" services. In VW's case, this appears to be an act of desperation.Consumers don't have to \"subscribe\" to this sort of gamesmanship. There are alternatives --- as evidenced by the performance of VW earnings --- down almost 40% over the past year.",

    "textPlain": "There’s already a growing market for companies that just sell you a quality good without ongoing service fees or data harvesting/surveillance; cars only recently really joined that list, which frustrates me.On the one hand, I appreciate the potential such data collection allows: proactive maintenance reminders, repair scheduling, TCO reductions, and even factory-line improvements by identifying flaws before they turn into class actions.On the other hand, none of that is what they’re actually doing. It’s all about juicing revenue instead of reducing costs, and treating paying customers like loot pinatas to be clubbed repeatedly for dosh.I’d like to believe there’s a market for smaller, simpler, EV-based “retro-inspired” cars that aren’t jam-packed with modems and sensors to phone home. Maybe someday I’ll be proven right.",
