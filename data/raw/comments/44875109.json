Whether this is an issue is a matter for debate. Certainly, until now, no-one has chosen to flex like this.",

But the nature of these attacks is that there's no longer one true blockchain. You can create one fork of the blockchain where you send the money to someone, receive goods in return, and then afterwards switch to a longer fork of the blockchain where the money was never sent.)",
