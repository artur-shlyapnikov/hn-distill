Experiments like these are only meant to simulate aspects of the real world, not perfectly represent its complexity.\"> Behavior may be different if participants had earned their points rather than simply received them, or both Proposers and Responder shared a common identity or wider goal.> \"Still,\" Dr. Gordon continues, \"it is a reminder that we should be mindful of attempts to limit the ability to hold power to account. For example, through anti-protest, anti-strike, and voter suppression laws.
