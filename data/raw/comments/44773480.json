Signing and conveying signatures for this object are predictably painful.\"The signature section contains one or more cryptographic signatures of a reduced version of the user record. This is used to ensure that only user records defined by a specific source are accepted on a system, by validating the signature against the set of locally accepted signature public keys. The signature is calculated from the JSON user record with all sections removed, except for regular, privileged, perMachine. Specifically, binding, status, signature itself and secret are removed first and thus not covered by the signature. This section is optional, and is only used when cryptographic validation of user records is required (as it is by systemd-homed.service for example).\"This all seems very brittle and I don't see the kinds of testing that would project confidence in this system.  Good luck to all who use this and trust it.",

This is the same sort of pathetically marginal garbage that damns Snaps, which somehow think that large environments put all user directories in /home - even that that is NOT a standard and doesn't scale worth a damn.Systemd is a curse, the TRON MCP that doesn't even seem have a system for alternate solutions to compete.  Before systemd we saw a more lively environment of alternatives for each service area, but systemd strangles this with a collection of mediocrities, and lack of foresight.Looking through the doc at https://systemd.io/HOME_DIRECTORY/ shows a entire webpage built of ideas many would rightfully reject, some defy standards, some defy common sense, and best practices, fail to scale, add arbitrary constraints, or have other problems.I've been a sysadmin at large sites before. systemd-homed looks a lot like unusable trash.</tirade>",
