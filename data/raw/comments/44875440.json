The repo had more than just the creator maintaining it, so we had real conversations and planning sessions with maintainers before making changes. We were transparent, kept them in the loop, and appreciated the support.I guess that SEO is also important somewhat. But if the product itself is good, which I assume it is as you bought it, then that should fix itself over time. Even more so because the repo is still \"just a baby\" considering the first commit was in March of this year. So by the end of the year you should be right back on track, probably sooner as you aren't starting from scratch.I mean, I guess the big lesson is to not buy a open source repository hoping to use it for marketing. Which, seems like common sense to me if I am being honest. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
