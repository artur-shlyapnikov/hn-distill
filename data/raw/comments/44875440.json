Coplay seem to have identified this and decided to invest in the idea without considering strategy.Owning a popular repository that your audience is engaged with is valuable because they’re using your free software: you create loyal users that you can then sell to. A successful open source project operated by your company is valuable as a lead generator. The repository itself has no value. Open source by business (this strategy) is just freemium for software.Why they thought announcing the acquisition of a repository would be of interest to anyone is beyond me.",

But if you don't need fake activity, it is not a problem, because a real people who really looking for solution will be able to click one more link.On the other hand, this way ensure that whole content will be available by indexed links.How to prevent 404 and why people still faces with it on GitHub?",

It's not unreasonable, and I don't want to comment on whether those specific motivations are \"good\" or \"bad\", but do want to point out obvious issues:> we like open source and want Unity MCP to stay relevant and open source indefinitely.It goes both ways. What happens if your startup goes under, which has a 99% probability? By that time, the project roadmap and governance is completely under your company's control. How/if are you going to \"return\" the project to open source community, and would it still matter then?> SEO of the repo gets resetTo be honest it is not completely unreasonable, and that is indeed one more thing to worry if it completely depends on another company's whim. Also, SEO is rarely a thing people talk about when maintaining a project, and this is the first time I see \"SEO\" and OSS appearing in the same sentence.> It's possible that nobody cares when tiny companies acquire fairly popular OSS repos. Our social posts barely moved the needle.What do you expect? If I have to guess, there is not a ton of overlap of (heavy) social media users and open source contributors, and even less so for these projects that focus on specific areas.* Not really free, there is a one-time purchase fee, apparently.",

The repo had more than just the creator maintaining it, so we had real conversations and planning sessions with maintainers before making changes. We were transparent, kept them in the loop, and appreciated the support.I guess that SEO is also important somewhat. But if the product itself is good, which I assume it is as you bought it, then that should fix itself over time. Even more so because the repo is still \"just a baby\" considering the first commit was in March of this year. So by the end of the year you should be right back on track, probably sooner as you aren't starting from scratch.I mean, I guess the big lesson is to not buy a open source repository hoping to use it for marketing. Which, seems like common sense to me if I am being honest. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
