Here is what the website previously tweeted about its future a year ago after winding down operations.[1]Originally heard this via https://x.com/System360Cheese/status/1951501044875477254.The latest indexed frontpage in the Internet Archive is from July 28: https://web.archive.org/web/20250728143805/https://www.anand....The original farewell article, which is now only readable through the IA: https://web.archive.org/web/20250726035557/https://www.anand.... One paragraph reads:\"And while the AnandTech staff is riding off into the sunset, I am happy to report that the site itself won’t be going anywhere for a while. Our publisher, Future PLC, will be keeping the AnandTech website and its many articles live indefinitely. So that all of the content we’ve created over the years remains accessible and citable. Even without new articles to add to the collection, I expect that many of the things we’ve written over the past couple of decades will remain relevant for years to come – and remain accessible just as long.\"[1]: https://x.com/anandtech/status/1829489697384706555    > AnandTech will stay online so readers can continue to access articles from our archive, and the forums will remain active to serve our community. Our sister site Tom's Hardware, will also continue to publish all the latest news, reviews and more from the PC world. Thank you all",

    "textPlain": "I honestly don't understand why companies do this.  There's still SO MUCH traffic from Google for these things.I've routinely went to AnandTech EXCLUSIVELY from Google.  This means that their \"news\" and new content is of little relevance to me, as it's usually something from a few years prior that I'm reading over there.  Yet somehow, \"have to publish every day\"?!Part of me thinks that this is related to the inefficiencies of all these CMS, where it costs too much to run the site compared to the revenue from the ads.Or is there another reason?Frankly, as an nginx \"practitioner\", all of these sites could basically be cached and served from a single $50/mo server from Hetzner, Online or OVH.  Aren't they're getting far more in ad revenue than that?  How does it make any sense to close the shop when you've got such a treasure trove that you could continue milking easily for at least like half a decade?",
