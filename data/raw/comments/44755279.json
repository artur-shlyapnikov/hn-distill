    "textPlain": "I started doing some experimentation with this new Deep Think agent, and after five prompts I reached my daily usage limit. For $250 USD/mo that’s what you’ll be getting folks.It’s just bizarrely uncompetitive with o3-pro and Grok 4 Heavy. Anecdotally (from my experience) this was the one feature that enthusiasts in the AI community were interested in to justify the exorbitant price of Google’s Ultra subscription. I find it astonishing that the same company providing free usage of their top models to everybody via AI Studio is nickel-and-diming their actual customers like that.Performance-wise. So far, I couldn’t even tell. I provided it with a challenging organizational problem that my business was facing, with the relevant context, and it proposed a lucid and well-thought-out solution that was consistent with our internal discussions on the matter. But o3 came to an equally effective conclusion for a fraction of the cost, even if it was less “cohesive” of a report. I guess I’ll have to wait until tomorrow to learn more.",
