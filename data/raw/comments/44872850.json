It really makes me believe that the models do not really understand the topic, even the basics but just try to predict the text.One recent example was me asking the model to fix my docker-compose file. In it, there's the `network: host` for the `build` part. The model kept assuming that the container would be running with the host network and kept asking me to remove it as a way to fix my issue, even though it wouldn't do anything for the container that is running. Because container runs on `custom_net` network only. The model was obsessed with it and kept telling me to remove it until I explicitly told that it is not, and cannot be the issue.```\nservices:  app:\n\n    build:\n\n      network: host\n\n    networks:\n\n      custom_net:\n\n    ...\n\n```",

    "textPlain": "It's interesting that there's still such a market for this sort of take.> In a recent pre-print paper, researchers from the University of Arizona summarize this existing work as \"suggest[ing] that LLMs are not principled reasoners but rather sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text.\"What does this even mean? Let's veto the word \"reasoning\" here and reflect.The LLM produces a series of outputs. Each output changes the likelihood of the next output. So it's transitioning in a very large state space.Assume there exists some states that the activations could be in that would cause the correct output to be generated. Assume also that there is some possible path of text connecting the original input to such a success state.The reinforcement learning objective reinforces pathways that were successful during training. If there's some intermediate calculation to do or 'inference' that could be drawn, writing out a new text that makes that explicit might be a useful step. The reinforcement learning objective is supposed to encourage the model to learn such patterns.So what does \"sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text\" even mean here? The mechanism that the model uses to transition towards the answer is to generate intermediate text. What's the complaint here?It makes the same sort of sense to talk about the model \"reasoning\" as it does to talk about AlphaZero \"valuing material\" or \"fighting for the center\". These are shorthands for describing patterns of behaviour, but of course the model doesn't \"value\" anything in a strictly human way. The chess engine usually doesn't see a full line to victory, but in the games it's played, paths which transition through states with material advantage are often good -- although it depends on other factors.So of course the chain-of-thought transition process is brittle, and it's brittle in ways that don't match human mistakes. What does it prove that there are counter-examples with irrelevant text interposed that cause the m",
