    "textPlain": "When one travels, one frequently sees signs in airport arrivals halls: do not accept lifts from unlicensed / unmarked vehicles, as it is not safe. Use a licensed, vetted taxi service.Uber's entire business model is, essentially, supplying unlicensed taxi services. I am honestly surprised it works as well as it does.",

    "textPlain": "The NYT is moving more and more into scaremongering articles. This is a great example where the title says \"Sexual Assault\" but within the article it mentions the vast majority are nothing near as serious as assault (but obviously still a problem).The article does not compare or contrast the rates to other industries, situations or just living life in general. My comment is not to absolve Uber, but rather point out that the article does not do a good job at proving that Uber is any more dangerous than a variety of other places/activities/things.",
