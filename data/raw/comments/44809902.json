    "textPlain": "This is an interesting development, especially considering the growing trend of code-sharing platforms. As others have pointed out, this move by GitHub to allow UV to run GitHub Gists blurs the lines between code hosting and execution environments. It's worth noting that this also puts UV in direct competition with other code execution services like Repl. it and Google Colab, both of which have been gaining traction in the developer community. I'm curious to see how UV will differentiate itself in this crowded space.",
