I regularly give it as an example alongside things like Blender to show that a better, more free software world is possible outside of just developer tools.",

I know it is a virtual DJ deck, but it is also a fantastic music player.That being said the following sentence makes me a bit concerned \"The current user interface of Mixxx has served us well, but as technology evolves, so must we.\"As far as I know QWidget is neither deprecated nor are there any plans for that.\nI think Mixxx has one of the best UI's I ever encountered, in design and execution. Please don't botch this.",

    "textPlain": "Mixxx is a great piece of software, even better that it's OSS and runs linux. Exciting to see a new major release.I've been using it lately (2.x) just mixing internally and with cue points set up in my tracks, and using the laptop keyboard for shortcuts. Works really well. For the occasional xfade etc I do have an external MIDI controller mapped to the xfade, levels, and eq but could get away without it for my style of mixing.Been DJing off and on for 25y and producing electronic music for 30y.",

For a while I tried to influence the direction of mixxx and was getting great feedback from other DJs but none from the developers.This was my great introduction to why I will never be a great developer, and why open source will never be on par with paid professional software.  I admire their efforts, but mixxx will always be a hobby project in my eyes.",

Honestly, I feel a little lacking in the fundamentals of digital audio so I’m probably going to focus on that before going too deep, but so far mixxx has been great! It was pretty hard for me to navigate, but that’s 100% because I have no idea what I’m doing. Curious to seeing if the update will help with discoverability.",
