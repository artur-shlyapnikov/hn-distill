    "textPlain": "I appreciate Mistral (and others) releasing their weights for free. But given how llama.cpp underpins a lot of the programs which allow users to run open weight models, it is a little frustrating to have companies which brag about releasing models to the community, leave the community to their own devices to slowly try and actually implement their models.I hear the reason for this is that llama.cpp keeps breaking basic things, so they have become an unreliable partner. Seems this is what Ollama is trying to address by diluting their connections to llama.cpp and directly contacting companies training these models to have simultaneous releases (e.g. GPT-OSS).",
