For usernames for example I’ve yet to create a generator that uses LLMs that beats simple Markov chains. Maybe because results are subjective it makes rating / training a lot harder? I like the site and your approach though and great job on lookup speed! If anyone has any tricks or suggestions I'd love to hear them.",

Sorry to be harsh but this is awful UX in terms of reviewing search results. Every thing I search said 0 available so I searched again and again. Then I scrolled down and noticed they were being checked as I scrolled and the number of available domains matching actually become >0. Not how i want to see the results.FWIW, I’ve had similar complaints about LDS and a few lines if javascript will clean up their search result page (exclude .blog and unavailable).
