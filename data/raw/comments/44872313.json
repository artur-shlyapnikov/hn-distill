It depends on what you're trying to do.The slimmed down version of a Finnish dictionary I provide in `tsk` [1] weighs in at around 30 MB, for about 250,000 Finnish words. It's small enough that I embed the whole dictionary directly into the binary and reconstruct the prefix search on the fly every time the user starts the app.However, the much larger database which contains things like lemmatization and etymology information easily balloons up to many, many gigabytes in size. My problem domain is providing Truly Instant Lookup, keystroke by keystroke, so I can't really get around this level of memoization. The work to figure all this out was sufficient that I decided to make future versions a paid product instead [2].Most other use cases would just call out to a server, because it's silly to think most people are going to download a giant database for that use case alone. A hybrid approach could also make a lot of sense, eg cache the most common 10,000 words locally and call out for the next 1.5 million, which are statistically extremely rare.[1]: https://github.com/hiandrewquinn/tsk[2]: https://taskusanakirja.com/ (offline for now until I get Digicert to certify my downloads wholesome for Windows resale)",

Without these the package will not break, but some very useful functionality might be disabled.The package-class you're talking about is \"suggests\", IOW, \"these packages might also be useful for you, wanna look?\" section. These are not installed by default already.On the other hand, apt and aptitude provides previews before doing something. You don't have to accept them. In aptitude's case, you can fine tune before the final commit, even.There's a tension. Minimalism vs. user utility. Somebody told in Debian 13 release comments that \"Debian will never be a end-user friendly distro\". Now, you're saying that packages shouldn't install recommends by default.What should Debian be? \"An IKEAesque DIY distro\", or \"A more user friendly, yet very stable and vanilla distro\". I vote for the latter, personally. Plus, as I told before, advanced users are free to use what they want to change.If you want to change the default, the configuration files are at /etc/apt/conf.d/. If you want to disable feature for once, it's --no-install-recommends.",

Wayland has a copy/paste protocol, and my 5-minute web search indicates that it works much like the X11 copy paste protocol, each application takes care of what will be sent when pasted. then some other application requests a paste, the display server connects the two they negotiate a format and the \"copied\" data squirts across. that is to say Wayland applications can totally capture text from other applications.Now if the article meant to say Wayland applications are unable to capture arbitrary text via mechanisms other than then the copy paste protocol I would say fair enough, but it sounds like the problem application is using the normal X11 copy paste protocol. so I don't see how that statement is relevant.",
