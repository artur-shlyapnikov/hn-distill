If that manufacturer key is known, it only takes two samples from an authenticator to determine the sequence key.Absent the manufacturer key, jamming+replay attacks work, but brute forcing a sequence key is generally prohibitively costly.However, since any receiver that supports field programming needs the magic \"manufacturer key\", one could purchase such a unit, and may be able to extract said key.",
