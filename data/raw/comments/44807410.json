(Side note: this assumes VHDL or SystemVerilog--old-school Verilog is terribly anemic in ways that SystemVerilog mostly fixed)Now, my testbench, on the other hand, is dramatically helped by being in a real programming language with the appropriate constructs.  However, we already have cocotb (in Python!) which fits the bill there and interfaces directly with my simulators without a translation step.",
