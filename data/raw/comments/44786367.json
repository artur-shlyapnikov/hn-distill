You recognize that pilots have limited situational bandwidth, and you REALLY don't want to be bugging them about things you can avoid. I worked in collision avoidance systems (TAS/TCASI/TCASII), and spent nearly a whole year just working on figuring out when and how we could avoid warning pilots in cases where \"we're not sure exactly what is going on, so tell the pilot just in case\" could potentially annoy pilots in cases like take off and landing (where they have important OTHER things to be doing!)It's a fun balance between \"possibly don't warn the pilot about something they should know about\", and \"don't warn them if they are busy doing something important\".More devices should have a \"squelch\" switch!",

It invited discussion by investing up-front in fleshing out the writer's thoughts. So much interaction on the internet now is just getting a shot in and disappearing back into the forest before the person you're responding to can reasonably react. It's generating the screenshot of their comment and your \"drop the mic\" response, designed to be consumed by people as a single serving after the comment rather than to engage in anything substantive.Also the author is absolutely right: whether it's my car, my washing machine, my oven, my fridge, an app on my phone, w/e it needs to stfu about anything that is non-critical. I do my best to enforce a rule where if I'm using a tool for a workflow and that tool interrupts with information or options not critical to that workflow I just stop using that tool. Difficult in the case of a car but at least in the case of apps I can usually enforce it via a three strikes mechanism. No, I don't want to sign up for email alerts.
