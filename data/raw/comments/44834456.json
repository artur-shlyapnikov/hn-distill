    "textPlain": "SpecificsÂ of only putting tariffs on 1kg bars and not other sizes seems utterly pointless. The article itself points out that people will just ship different sized bars to the US instead and re-cast them on arrival.It doesn't actually say what the new tariff rate will be, so the decision on whether to procure different sized bars / cast before shipping, and whether to recast in the US or just sell different sized bars in the US will ultimately just be a decision on whether all of that is cheaper than the new tariff. My guess is that at any significant volume, it'll be cheaper to recast.",
