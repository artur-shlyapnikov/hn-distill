Then, multiple years of nothing as the summer ended.Since then, many of the protocols condensed into a few very very active protocols. Turtle has $1.1B deployed in only two campaigns. AAVE has $55B. Morpho has $10B. There are tons more protocols doing just fine.",

Issues with contracts of those tokens could tank their value and thereby affecting your stablecoin value.It all comes down to introduction of points of trust in interconnected systems.
