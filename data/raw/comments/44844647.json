    "textPlain": "For some subjects, it's appropriate to host multiple versions of articles written natively in different languages.But for other subjects, for example science and mathematics, it does a huge disservice to non-English readers: it means that their Wikipedia is second-rate, or worse.Wikipedia should, in science, mathematics, and other subjects that do not have cultural inflection, use  machine translation so that all articles in all languages are translations of the same underlying semantic content.It would still be written by humans. But ML / LLMs would be involved in the editing pipeline so that people lacking a common language can edit the same text.This is the biggest mistake Wikipedia's made IMO: it privileges  English readers since the English content is highest quality in most areas that are not culturally specific, and I do not think that it's an organization that wants to privilege English readers.",
