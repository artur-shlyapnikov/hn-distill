But ML / LLMs would be involved in the editing pipeline so that people lacking a common language can edit the same text.This is the biggest mistake Wikipedia's made IMO: it privileges  English readers since the English content is highest quality in most areas that are not culturally specific, and I do not think that it's an organization that wants to privilege English readers.",
