I don't understand where they think this is going ...",

    "textPlain": "It’s pretty clear that October 7th was the excuse the Israeli leadership was waiting for. They finally have causus belli to pacify Gaza one way or another. They might not raze it to the ground, that would have bad optics, but they’re certainly going to try to make life there unpleasant enough that the locals won’t protest too much if they’re forcefully relocated elsewhere.A lot of western commentators are up in arms about the mistreatment and suffering but they’re missing the bigger picture: that’s the point. The suffering is the goal, not a side effect. The quiet part has been said out load enough (thanks Trump!) that we can’t act surprised.What actually happens in the next couple of years hinges on how much political capital Bibi has left and how hard the general populace of Israel protests the atrocities committed in their name.",
