    "textPlain": "I think the answer is yes. Modern efforts to formalize mathematics use type theory a lot, specifically calculus of inductive constructions, rather than ZFC.At around 2000, I studied applied mathematics. I was curious about automated theorem proving, but I didn't understand the language (being, as most mathematicians, trained in proving with classical logic rather than type theory). Years later I discovered Haskell, which became a \"gateway drug\" to type theory. I wish something like Lean had existed 25 years ago, when I was a student.I think fully formal methods in mathematics are the future, and every math student should learn a bit of Lean (or a similar tool, but IMHO Lean has the best tutorials, aimed at people with traditional education). Hence, everybody should learn basics of type theory.",

Functional programmers with strict types organize their data with complex types, while I do the same with classes.

    "textPlain": "The OP goes on to immediate ask whether category theory or type theory can serve as a foundation for mathematics (they give a link to an article that talks of \"foundational styles\" but which doesn't give a process of explicitly \"cutting the cord\" from set theory).I think the answer by (perhaps infamous) Paul Taylor in this mathoverflow post[1] is a clearer expression of the positions of those who want to jettison traditional set theory as the foundation of mathematics.\"The crucial issue is whether you are taken in by the Great Set-Theoretic Swindle that mathematics depends on collections (completed infinities)\"Yes, it's important to remember that everything labeled \"infinity\" in math doesn't \"exist-exist\" but rather is some combination of unending process and arbitrary labeling (see Skolem's paradox etc). But that doesn't mean such nominally completed infinities aren't useful or even necessary for a human being to grasp mathematics.Anyway, for this debate it's worth reading all of Taylor's comment (which isn't to say I share his position but it's good to understand where the \"finitests\" are coming from).[1] https://mathoverflow.net/questions/8731/categorical-foundati...",

    "textPlain": "Let's say I ask, \"Why is it worth spending time in Baltimore?\"I could get answers about the national anthem, about Camden Yards, about good restaurants and bars.  Those are \"tourist\" answers.Or I could get answers about job availability and cost of housing.  Those are \"move there\" answers.It seems to me that this article (if you can call it that) gives mostly \"tourist\" answers, not \"move there\" answers.  Well, that's all right in a way - for an academic topic, you probably have to get tourists before you get people moving there.  But the problem is that mathematicians have a large number of areas that they could visit as tourists, and nothing here tells them why type theory is better to visit than, say, algebraic topology.And that doesn't solve the original complaint.  Why are so few people working in type theory?  Because more of the action is in set theory and category theory, and type theory offers too little that the others don't, so nobody's going to switch.I mean, most mathematicians aren't really in foundations anyway.  They're in differential equations or prime numbers or complex analysis or algebraic topology or something like that, and making your foundation type theory instead of set theory makes no difference whatsoever to those people.  Only the people working on foundations care, and as I said, most of those people already work in set theory or category theory, and type theory doesn't give them a good enough reason to uproot and move.",
