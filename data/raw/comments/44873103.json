    "textPlain": "Mesa is also usable on other platforms, including Windows and macOS.It's even theoretically possible to use the Asahi Linux hardware Mesa drivers on macOS, though actually doing so would involve hacking around undocumented APIs. I actually thought this was demonstrated before (during early testing) but I can't find it.Someone else managed to get the RADV AMD driver working on Windows[1]. It is not fully merged upstream yet, but I think they would like to get it merged upstream eventually.Windows 10 on ARM (maybe Windows 11?) also use Mesa with Microsoft and Collabora's d3d12 backend to run OpenGL and OpenCL applications on top of d3d12, for hardware that does not have proper OpenGL and OpenCL drivers[2].And of course, it ought to be possible to use llvmpipe/lavapipe with off-screen rendering pretty much anywhere you can get Mesa to build, although in practice I believe SwiftShader usually nets you a lot better performance if it's applicable.So Mesa is actually not used only on Linux, it can be used pretty much anywhere, actually ships with Windows, and of course many other free software operating systems also ship Mesa.[1]: https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-Windows-XDC-2024[2]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-the-opencl...",
