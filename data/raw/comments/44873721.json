    "textPlain": "Nice! IMO, needsÂ to be significantly harder. I was able to survive for 45 seconds on my first try--that's long enough that I start getting bored, and I don't really want to try again because it'll take at least a full 45 seconds to beat my previous score.By comparison, consider how long a typical Flappy Bird game lasts, particularly on your first try--probably less than 10 seconds at most! That makes you want to try again.",
