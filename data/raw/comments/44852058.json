    "textPlain": "From what I've read, the Vatican observatory bought one of Galileo's scopes, it didn't work very well, they bought an improved one, and confirmed his observations.

    "textPlain": "\"For centuries, the trial of Galileo has received far more attention than any other aspect of his life. The conflict between religion and science still rumbles on in the debates over Darwinism and intelligent design.\"To me, it's worse than Dawinism vs intelligent design.
