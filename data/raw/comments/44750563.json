Good servers can earn a lot more money than what they’d earn if every server were paid the same, fair wage.My mom used to work at a furniture store as a floor sales associate on commission. She would regularly clear $120,000/year (this was 15 years ago, so like $180,000 today). A generous wage for the job at the time probably would’ve been $50,000 or so.

This is incorrect as humans had 'tipping' all the way back to earliest recorded times.In the middle ages vails or informal rewards were given to well performing servants.  In the Roman times corollarium (Lucilius, Seneca), a form of tipping was known.  Cicero referred to tipping as stipen although some argue that is not above regular pay.There are some evidence that in the Han Dynasty, gifts were bestowed on well performing eunuchs, above their normal pay.  Considering that in ancient times payments often were in non-monetary compensation, this could be considered a progenitor of tipping.Incas had similar systems of rewarding service with goods like cloth, though not exactly like modern tipping.Tipping, as we understand it today, likely did not exist in the same form in ancient civilizations, but there were practices where extra gifts or payments were given for exceptional service.> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.",
