    "textPlain": "The high-level pitch of P cores and E cores seems so elegant, but when it actually comes to scheduling, it gets messy fast. Even in a laptop running off a battery, you can't simply switch to E cores because some short-lived work might be latency-sensitive. You also can't assume long-running work should be on an E core because maybe you're anxious to get that video encoded. Even for lots of small work, different core can have different performance characteristics, and a P core might be more efficient for certain workloads.",

    "textPlain": "Funny enough, Unix already has user-settable priorities, aka \"nice level\". ACPI gives us an idea how plentiful the power is.So, when powered by AC power, schedule everything on P cores when possible, schedule processes that eat a lot of CPU on P cores, same for any process with a negative nice value.When powered by a battery, schedule anything with non-negative nice value on E cores, keep one P core up for real-time tasks, and for nice-below-zero tasks.These are two extremes, but I suppose that the idea is understandable.",
