    "textPlain": "Even with data flow extension (also like ipyflow [0] ) I am still struggling with the execution model of notebooks in general. I often still see people defining functions and classes in notebooks to somehow handle prototyping loops.I would love to see DAGs like in SSA form of compilers, that also supports loop operators. However, IMHO also the notebook interface needs to adjust for that (cell indentation ?). However, the strength of notebooks rather shows in document authoring like quarto, which IMHO mostly contradicts more complex controll flow.[0] https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow",
