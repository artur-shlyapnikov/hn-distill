Is there no way to get it to do that? What the AI is doing instead is building-up the strokes of every character on the line of text all at once, which looks completely unnatural. The awkwardness is compounded by the fact that the letters are outlined, so it takes even more steps to create them.In addition, the line-art style of the illustrations looks like that same cartoonish-AI-slop style I see everywhere now. I just can't take it seriously.If this tool is widely deployed it's just going to get used to spread more misinformation. I'm sure it will be great for bad actors and spammers to have yet another tool in their toolbox to spread whatever weird content or messages they want. But for the rest of us, that means search engines and YouTube and other places will be filled with a million AI-generated half-baked inferior copies of Khan Academy. It's already hard enough to find good educational resources online if you don't know where to look, and this will only make the problem worse.You'll just have to forgive me if I'm not really excited about this tool....also the name is a bit weird. It reminds me of \"Gulpo, the fish who eats concepts\" from that classic SMBC cartoon. (https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2010-12-15)",
