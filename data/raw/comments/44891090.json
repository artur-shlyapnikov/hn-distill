Unfortunately the service invented its own idea of what the artefact looked like. Could you offer a storyboard view and let users erase the incorrect parts and sketch their own shapes? Or split the drawing up into logical elements and the user could redraw them as needed, which would then be reused where that element is used in other frames?",

These videos probably look fantastic to the person who wrote the document it summarizes, but to a newbie the information is fleeting and hard to follow.  The machine doesn't understand that the screen shouldn't be completely wiped all the time while it follows the narrative.
