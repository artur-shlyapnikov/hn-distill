Apple's implementation of declarativeNetRequest was semi-broken until the very latest iOS 18.6.Apple can do the bare minimum, years after everyone else, and barely get called out. The Reality Distortion Field is the enemy.Also funny that other devs had the gall to make people pay (sometimes subscriptions!) for Safari adblockers inferior to the free adblockers on any other browser.",
