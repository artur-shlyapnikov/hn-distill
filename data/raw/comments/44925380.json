Growth would make it worse, not better.\n>\n> Some things work precisely because they’re small.I'd argue this is true for social networks like Facebook actually. There was a magical period in Facebook between 2005 to 2010 or so where it was mostly college friends, high school friends, some work friends, and we all actually shared what we thought on our posts, shared links to interesting stuff, etc.When all the relatives started being added to your network the vibe became decidedly different, and then acquaintances, people who aren't close, etc. and everyone has that one experience where one time they post something and someone who isn't close get offended, whether it's political or not, and they gradually share less and less.",

In this analogy, your mom/boss/bigcorp-HR are the predators lurking in the Dark Forest. Knowing they're there makes you go silent, refusing to \"make yourself known\" / \"make yourself vulnerable\" in any way these predators might potentially latch onto.The analogy does break down a bit, because unlike alien civilizations in the cosmic void, there are signals we as individuals can send out on a social network that \"make us known\" at least somewhat but don't \"make us vulnerable.\" These are the \"performative, groomed\" posts you see shared on Facebook, posted on public Instagram accounts, blogged on LinkedIn, etc. (I suppose a more-precise name, that incorporates this consideration, would be the \"chaperone problem\" — but that's less evocative.)Social networks are good and fun and easy — possibly even a net positive for mental health — when they either inherently or coincidentally avoid becoming a dark forest.In real-world terms:• Interest-based activity groups (think \"knitting circle\" or \"D&D group\"), and community [not professional] sports leagues, are great social networks.• Conventions, youth summer camps, and adult workshops [think \"pottery class\"] are all also great — though ephemeral — social networks.• Group therapy se",
