    "textPlain": "Interesting article!  I always enjoy reading how people build and maintain their independent personal websites.  This post starts with the \"Comment System Problem\" and mentions four possible solutions, but I think there's a fifth that has worked well for me.After spending too much time fiddling with third-party comment systems, I ended up building my own [1].  It's pretty barebones, just does what I need, and nothing more.Each comment is written to a text file for manual review, so I don't have to worry about spam, cross-site scripting, or irrelevant comments.  I usually check them on weekends and add them to my blog.Comments are stored as plain HTML files, and my static site generator [2] builds the site along with the comment pages [3].  So in a way, it's also a static comment pages generator.This setup doesn't meet the five attributes (no infra, rich content, real identity, etc.) in the second section of the article, so it wouldn't suit the author's needs, but it has worked quite well for me.  I've been using it for at least four years (perhaps much longer, since my old PHP website did something similar), and I've been quite happy with it.[1] https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/form.lisp[2] https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/site.lisp[3] https://susam.net/comments/",

It would be great to put this on my blog and then have people able to comment on it, and basically the only way I interact with Blue Sky or any social media feed is through this kind of interface and through creating content.Over the years I've found that any interaction with social media that involves me loading the feed inevitably ends up with me doomscrolling or spending way too much time scrolling stuff that doesn't add anything to my life.

Completely invisible to your average user, both the potential for 'central lockdown'and cross site tracking that was 'invisible'.  Outsourcing a common webmaster maintenance task in a way that affected other people in ways they didn't realize. At first. We Men Who Yell At Clouds remember the before times.  Discus was the first commonly used script embed, even when people were copying and downloading,installing,serving their own libraries instead of linking to creepy sites.Security's better now in general.  But the same hands-on approach sometimes brought us widely exploited 0-days.  Drupal was obnoxious.  Yet people knew throbbing banner ads were cross-site things in a way you could turn off.",
