All forms (skim or otherwise) of cow mozzarella scorch fiercely at that temperature before the crust is done. Buffalo mozzarella does not. Some of my local markets carry Buf brand buffalo mozz, which is not from italy but is from the same animal (I think).The buf mozz is the thing that takes my homemade pizza from \"meh\" to \"actually, this is pretty good\". I'm working on getting it to \"wow, this is great\" but that will require further refinement of my crust technique, I think.",
