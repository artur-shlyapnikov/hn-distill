They had built their business by taking a cut from every picture you took, from the rolls of film to the developing to the printing.  There was absolutely nothing in the digital camera realm that could duplicate that; their revenue dropped like a rock.  If they had sold every single digital camera ever bought, it wouldn't have made up for it.The contrast between Kodak and Fujifilm is fascinating.  Fujifilm survived by pivoting to manufacturing critical components for LCD panels, which were exploding in popularity at the time.  https://web.archive.org/web/20250704224940/https://petapixel...",

This strategy was abandoned in 1990s.- 1990s: Kodak tried to become a Digital Imaging company. While it saw a brief success, Kodak lost the competition.- 2000s: Kodak tried to become an Inkjet Printer company, which was doomed and eventually pushed it into bankruptcy.- 2010s: Kodak tried to become a Blockchain company, issuing KodakCoin. It was a flop.- 2020s: Kodak tried to become a Pharmaceutical company amid Covid-19 pandemic.As of today, Kodak is focusing on its chemical business (such as manifacturing KODALUX, a fabric coating material) and borrowed $477M (at 12% p.a.) in order to expand that business line.That loan is due in 2026.

Great!

    "textPlain": "> Interesting to compare the tech companies of last century with those of this era.The 'tech companies' (equivalent) of the past tended to deal with physical goods, and so needed physical means of scaling to become as large as they did.More recent tech companies are often software goods and services, where physical means of scaling may not be as important (though see perhaps with Moore and Dennard). Though those which deal with physical stuff do seem to have higher counts; see below.> The number of people benefiting from an enterprise has shrunk considerably, with the benefits accruing more tightly within an already wealthy class.Not sure if this is completely accurate. Kodak topped out at 145,000 employees in 1988:* https://rbj.net/2017/09/13/kodaks-decades-of-decline/Apple has 164,000; Microsoft has 228,000; Amazon has 1,610,000.* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers",
