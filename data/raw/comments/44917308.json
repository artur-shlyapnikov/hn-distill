    "textPlain": "Brazil chose Gripen very soon after it Snowden leaks had revealed had intercepted Dilma Rouseff personal communications. I will be lazy here and paste a ChatGPT summary since I recalled the outline but not the details:It’s very likely it played a significant role in the final choice — not necessarily as the only reason, but as a decisive tie-breaker.Here’s why:1. Timing was suspiciously closeSnowden’s NSA revelations came out in mid-2013.Rousseff’s UN speech condemning U.S. spying was in September 2013.Brazil announced the Saab Gripen NG selection in December 2013 — just three months later.2. Boeing’s bid was politically radioactive\nEven if the Air Force had rated the F/A-18 highly, the president would have had to approve the purchase. After the scandal, a U.S. fighter buy would have looked domestically like ignoring a national insult.3. Public and congressional pressure\nBrazilian media hammered the NSA issue for months, and opposition politicians would have used a U.S. aircraft deal as evidence of weakness or hypocrisy.4. The other contenders were “good enough”\nGripen NG wasn’t the cheapest in sticker price (Rafale was more expensive), but it was competitive in capability and far stronger in technology transfer terms. That made it easy to justify dropping the U.S. option without taking a big performance hit.My assessment: If the NSA scandal hadn’t happened, Boeing would still have faced challenges on tech transfer, but it would likely have been the Gripen or F/A-18 in the final decision. With the scandal, the F/A-18 had near-zero chance — the scandal probably moved the Gripen from “contender” to “winner.”",
