If there really are infinite universes, is there a one when I'm walking a street full of people and out of nowhere we all start singing Ode to Joy in perfect unisono? Or get naked and have a massive orgy? No law of physics rules this out.(Sorry, I'm a layman.)",

    "textPlain": "> So why are we immoral then?Mostly because it's easier than the alternative.More seriously, you've just described the \"moral\" of the story of Adam and Eve. In that view of the world our problem is that we understand morality (thanks to that apple eating strumpet) and therefore can make choices. Animals, infants, and the simple-minded have no such concept and therefore can't be held responsible for violating it.This, of course, all nonsense and implies a sort of paternalistic universe, but it was always going to be that way. Everything we know is defined by it's relationship to something else we know, and we don't know God. We know Dad.Fundamentally it's a way to make God seem like less of a child-abusing jerk. A sky-daddy who \"punishes\" those who understand morality, but grants slack to the cutie-patootie babies and puppies is just nicer for people to believe in.",
