If there's a clear and identifiable threat, we can build dikes or sea walls or spillways or whatever it is that can alleviate the issue. \"Think of the insurance implications\" is a silly distraction.",

We can't leave this to insurers - we need strong cooperation between governments and academia to plot a better course into our brave new world.",
