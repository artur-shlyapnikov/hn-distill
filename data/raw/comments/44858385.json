To the point \"1 in 100 year\" is now a standing joke.",

    "textPlain": "This seems based on outdated science to me. The world isn't just \"getting hotter\", the overall climate is changing due solely to human influence. The article makes it sound like insurers believe houses will start spontaneously combusting. What they should really worry about is desertification in populated areas and flooding along the coasts, and the inevitable humanitarian crisis and necessary social restructuring that those will require. We can't leave this to insurers - we need strong cooperation between governments and academia to plot a better course into our brave new world.",

    "textPlain": "Insurance is supposed to average out small probability high impact events across a large number of smaller payments from more people. It is entirely expected to loose money on insurance as a single customer - that's usually great. It means your house hasn't burned down, you're in good healt and you bike hasn't been stolen. If we're now moving towards a world where due to man-made climate change certain classes of risks are no longer insurable, everyone looses.",
