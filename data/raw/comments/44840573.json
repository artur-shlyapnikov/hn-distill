Most people try to teach card games by listing every rule, but it's much easier to play a simpler version then add in new rules.I play the Chinese card game Zhao Peng You (Finding Friends, part of the Sheng Ji family of games https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji), which is a trick taking game with a trump suit that changes between games, a trump number that changes between games, and a team selection mechanic rather than fixed teams. It's insanely hard to learn everything at once, so we usually start new people with fixed teams and trumps just to get the feel of a team-based trick-taking game, before adding in the complications.",

    "textPlain": "I have always been mystified by the popularity of poker. To me, it is an unpleasant game.First - the fact that it's played for real money. If I win, I feel like a common swindler stealing money that someone could use to pay their bills or buy something nice for themselves. If I lose, I feel like a swindler's victim. And if the people around the table happen to be my friends - why would I ever wish to victimize them, or ruin their image in my mind by watching them victimize others?Second - the lack of information. Many interesting games provide incomp9lete information of game state to the players,  which one then needs to reconstruct. But with poker, the lack of information is so severe that one has no hope of reconstructing the game state - reasonable possibilities are too many to analyze, one is forced to pretty much guess and make gambles. It's an unpleasant experience.It seems like a game for people whose brains are wired in a manner incompatible with mine. If I discover that someone likes poker, I find them rather suspicious. And people who teach poker to their own children - like the article'a author - are, to me, utterly incomprehensible.",

Don’t get attached to a bad hand and don’t convince yourself that an ok hand is a good hand. If you just fold the bad hands and play the good ones you’re already a better player than most.I took that to heart and it has served me well in life.",

It will be lower if they get fewer entries, but let's say they get exactly 30. Then 3 players are going home with more than they came with.

People playing poker with \"funny money\" play the game fundamentally differently to the extent it's almost a different game (arguably worse, certainly less predictable) entirely.If you take the money out of it you have to replace it with something that matters to the players outside of the game itself for it to work.(On the lack of information - some versions of poker are different than others but imo Texas Holdem has enough shared information that, combined with the knowledge that people really care about winning or losing informing your ability to read them based on their actions enables very strategic gameplay - the existence of a pro scene with players that consistently do well at a high level of play is evidence of this)As another aside - I see similar complaints about strategy games that include RNG for things like attack values, and I also disagree with that criticism.
