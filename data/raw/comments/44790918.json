    "textPlain": "Speedhunters was the best way to experience broad car culture as a young kid in high school, in its prime it used to be two articles a day of well-written and photographed car features from all over the world in every style, all presented with no ads. A shame to see it go as there's nothing else really like it out there, now it's all scattered across instagram and various youtube channels. I'm hoping EA sells it off to someone who cares but knowing their track record they're likely to completely shut it down as soon as someone remembers it exists",

Between the tragic death of Ken Block, and the brand collapse of both of those companies I feel like we are in the dark ages of car culture now.But I still have hope and I think we will one day have a resurgence of car culture like it was.",
