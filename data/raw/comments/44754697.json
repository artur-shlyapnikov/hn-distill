    "textPlain": "From the article:> Weyl semimetals are materials that allow electricity to flow in unusual ways with very high speed and zero energy loss because of special relativistic quasi-particles called Weyl fermions. Spin ice, on the other hand, are magnetic materials where the magnetic moments (tiny magnetic fields within the material) are arranged in a way that resembles the positions of hydrogen atoms in ice. When these two materials are combined, they create a heterostructure, composed of atomic layers of dissimilar materials.I’m not going to pretend to understand how any of this works.How long do you have to work in physics until you grok things like this? And how much longer until you get to come up with cool names like “spin ice”.",

    "textPlain": "Pretty interesting, I recently build an nth order spherical harmonics encoder that can encode the electronic structure of a local environment (of n Å) into a high dimensional fingerprint. We can then use this to search against a big TB dataset of known structures we built to see if we can find analogous configurations. I've started building the structure in the article, I'm interested to see what a search turns up.",
