    "textPlain": "As an author who is currently under contract to finish a book, I'm a bit annoyed that AI really can't write for me. I'm busy, I really like writing, but writing a good book does involve serious time researching and exploring. I've tried to have AI help me through, but I've more often than not had to dive into source code and run experiments to make sure I understand what's going on. It's even a book on AI, so there would be no shame at all in using AI to write it.> So what am I good for anymore?And here I was thinking this question is why writers write at all. Who else would do something requiring so much work for so little reward but those who fundamentally think they aren't worth much, it's what unites us.But I don't think I worry about being replaced, not because I'm irreplaceable, but because if I could be completely replaced I think that might be quite a delightful experience. Imagine all those people who need something from you satisfied. That's what being replaced would entail: not a single person demanding a single thing from you. But unfortunately no, I'm still needed here, annoyingly.",

    "textPlain": "I’ve tried to use flagship models to produce long-ish technical writing content and the result has not been satisfactory.The resulting content lacks consistency and coherency. The generated prose is rather breathless: in carefully articulated content, every sentence should have a place. Flagship models (Opus 4~) don’t seem to understand the value of a sentence.I’ve tried to prompt engineer this behavior (one should carefully attend to each sentence: how is it contributing to the technical narrative in this section, and overall?), but didn’t have much success.I suspect this might be solved by research on grounding generation against world models: much of verifying “is this sentence correct here?” has to do with my sharing of a world model of some domain with my audience. I use that world model to debug my own writing.",

    "textPlain": "Exactly this sort of thing makes it feel like there could be a \"cliff\" or \"eternal winter of human publishing\", where books like his are never again written by humans.Often when tech comes out that does something better than people, it makes sense for people to stop doing it. But in the case of \"books explaining things\", AI only learned how to explain things by examining the existing corpus - and there won't be any more human-generated content to continue to learn and evolve from, so the explanatory skills of AI could wind up frozen in 2025.An alternative would of course be that humans team up with AI to write better books of this sort, and are able to develop new and better ways of explaining things at a more rapid pace as a result.A relatively recent example that sticks in my mind is how data visualization has improved. Documents from the second half of the 1900's are shockingly bad at data presentation, and the shock is due to how the standard of practice has improved in the last few decades. AI probably wouldn't have figured this out on its own, but is now able to train on many, many examples of good visualization.",

For one AI writing is often completely wrong about the details. But it also just tends to be bland and superficial. If you want a 5-minute summary of something, sure, it can do a passable job. But if I want something substantial and carefully thought out, I'll choose a book written by a human expert every time.Maybe this will change at some point in the future, but for now there's no way I would substitute a well-written book on a subject for AI slop.

There's no \"genAI\", there is \"genMS\" - generative machine statistics.When you look at it that way, it's obvious the models are build on enormous amounts of work done by people publishing the the internet. This amount of work is many orders of magnitude more hours than it took to produce the training algorithms.As a result, most of the money people pay to access these models should go to the original authors.And that even ignores the fact that a model trained on AGPL code should be licensed under AGPL as well as its output - even if no single training input can be identified in the output, it's quite straightforwardly _derived_ from enormous amounts of trainings data input and a tiny (barely relevant) bit of prompt input.

(Including glasses) That would be a world where our entire lives or a great deal of them, are devoted to computer generated facts, experiences, well, everything.There are still both creative and mundane experiences like the door molding that needs a fix.I've been through a few revolutions that \"changed everything\" From the phone without a dial (true) to cell phones that solve the formerly horrifying \"I couldn't find you at the airport\" situation.And so on.I guess that the existential question is: \"What is the purpose, meaning, and joy in life?\"It's not defined by the gadgets and technologies outside us, but truly by the relationships we have with people. So, if AI \"replaces\" my highly personal photographic experiences captured on film or memory, it's shared with close friends who know the story behind it and its value as an experience shared. I rarely post my photos anywhere, thanks to the image bureau and AI dragnets. They commoditize and destroy that personsl value. Art is self-expression. Read Joseph Conrad's preface [0]Likewise, as long as life is full of experiences away from computer screens (and glasses), those are real life, and the technology is just ornament.I had a plan for after-school education in which kids would go out and measure things and use computers to analyze the data. Like Kepler, but a lot faster. And the learning is in the doing.Very long ago, 50 years to be factual, I wanted to get a third class Electrician's Mate rating, and in those days, you could strike for a rating.
