Right now, my number seems to be about 3-5 tasks, if I review the output.If we assume 5 tasks, each running $400/mo of tokens, we reach an annual bill of $24,000.  We would have to see a 4x increase in token cost to reach the $100,000/yr mark.  This seems possible with increased context sizes.  Additionally, we might see additional context sizes lead to longer running more complicated tasks which would increase my number of parallel tasks.",

    "textPlain": "At some point the value of remote inference becomes more expensive than just buying the hardware locally, even for server-grade components. A GB200 is ~$60-70k and will run for multiple years. If inference costs continue to scale, at some point it just makes more sense to run even the largest models locally.OSS models are only ~1 year behind SOTA proprietary, and we're already approaching a point where models are \"good enough\" for most usage. Where we're seeing advancements is more in tool calling, agentic frameworks, and thinking loops, all of which are independent of the base model. It's very likely that local, continuous thinking on an OSS model is the future.",

It’s noted that the actual strategies the blog advertises are things used by tools like Cursor (via auto mode). The important thing for them is that they are able to successfully push users towards their auto mode and use more usage data to improve their routing and frontier models don’t continue to be so much better AND so expensive that users continue to demand them. I wouldn’t hate that bet if I were Cursor personally.",
