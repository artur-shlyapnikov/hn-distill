Requesting donations is the least effective monetizing strategy and yet it still works because of scale.Donations would probably work but Bluesky has additional options. They could create a premium app for power users that just adds nice-to-have features (which may cost real money to provide and maintain), they can resell domain names, they can sell merch, etc.Bluesky doesn't need to generate billions of dollars to be highly sustainable and profitable. It was built and scaled with fewer than 20 full time employees.The most important and most difficult part is getting to sufficient scale, and that's mostly a matter of just making the app even better than it is today.I posted a bit about this here: https://bsky.app/profile/jacob.gold/post/3lr5j6o7emk2t",

No matter who else is at the hot tub party, I don't have to  worry much about them peeing in my particular hot tub. I hear Mastodon is somewhat similar, but it's been a while.The balance between discovery and curation and control is nigh-on perfect for me in BlueSky. If I want to focus just on my corner of the science world, it's super easy for me to build a network of people just in that corner and not get spammed with, say, racially-tinged fight videos that are meant for engagement bait, as has happened on other social networks.If you want hyper-polarized communities, some of those can be found on BlueSky too!
