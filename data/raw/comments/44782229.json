    "textPlain": "To summarize: we're making a series of i.i.d. draws from a distribution and asking how many draws N we need to make until we get something larger than our first draw.Conditional on the value of the first draw, N is geometrically distributed. If we're drawing from an absolutely continuous distribution on the first line, then of course the details of our distribution don't matter: N is a draw from a geometric distribution with rate lambda, where lambda in turn is drawn uniformly from [0, 1]. It follows that N has a thick tail; for example, the expected value of N is the expected value of 1/lambda, which is infinite. In fact, N turns out to have a power law tail.However, this isn't true if we're drawing from a distribution that's not absolutely continuous. If you coarse-grain into just \"fast\" and \"slow\" cars, then N again has a thin (geometric) tail. More to the point, if we imagine that our queues of cars need to be formed within a finite amount of time, then a car is only added to the queue in front of it if its velocity is epsilon larger than the velocity of the queue, and the problematic situation where lambda -> 0 goes away. In this idealized scenario, I guess you could relate the rate of the exponential tail of N to how long the cars have been travelling for.Finally, it's worth remembering the old \"waiting-time paradox\": the variable N we're talking about is not the same as the length of the queue that a randomly selected driver finds themself in. What's the distribution of the latter---the distribution of \"experienced\" queue lengths? In this post the author computed that P(N = n) = 1/n(n + 1). It stands to reason that to get the density of the distribution of experienced lengths we need to multiply by n and divide by a normalizing constant. Unfortunately, you can't multiply 1/(n + 1) by any constant to get a probability distribution, since the sum over n diverges.What does it mean that the distribution of experienced queues lengths doesn't exist?

    "textPlain": "The conclusion looks correct for the wrong question: isn't this the formula for the  number of queues?The first car starts a queue with probability 1, the second car starts a queue if and only if it is slower (probability 1/2), the third car starts a queue if and only if it is the slowest so far (probability 1/3), and so on. Total is 1 + 1/2 + 1/3... which is the formula at the end of the blog post, with an off-by-one error.The average queue length should be the number of cars divided by this harmonic sum. Which also diverges to infinity.",
