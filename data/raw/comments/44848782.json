I understand the reasoning, and I won't deny it is a very niche platform by now. But I had hoped Debian, with a history of supporting a wide range of platforms, would keep i386 going for a while longer.Fortunately, bookworm will continue to receive updates for almost 3 years, so I am not in a hurry to look for a new OS for these relics. OpenBSD looks like the natural successor, but I am not sure if the wifi chips are supported. (And who knows how long these netbooks will continue to work, they were built in 2008 and 2009, so they've had a long life already.)",

I switched to Debian 6 after Ubuntu went way downhill and haven't had cause to regret it.I like Debian's measured pragmatism with ideology, how it's a distro of free software by default but it also makes it easy to install non-free software or firmware blobs. I like Debian's package guidelines, I like dpkg, I like the Debian documentation even if Arch remains the best on that front. I like the stable/testing package streams, which make it easy to choose old but rock-stable vs just a bit old and almost as stable.And one of the best parts is, I've never had a Debian system break without it being my fault in some way. Every case I've had of Debian being outright unbootable or having other serious problems, it's been due to me trying to add things from third-party repositories, or messing up the configuration or something else, but not a fault of the Debian system itself.",

    "textPlain": "Thank you to all the Debian volunteers that make Debian and all its derivatives possible. It's remarkable how many people and businesses have been enabled by your work. Thank you!On a personal note, Trixie is very exciting for me because my side project, ntfy [1], was packaged [2] and is now included in Trixie. I only learned about the fact that it was included very late in cycle when the package maintainer asked for license clarifications. As a result the Debian-ized version of ntfy doesn't contain a web app (which is a reaaal bummer), and has a few things \"patched out\" (which is fine). I approached the maintainer and just recently added build tags [3] to make it easier to remove Stripe, Firebase and WebPush, so that the next Debian-ized version will not have to contain (so many) awkward patches.As an \"upstream maintainer\", I must say it isn't obvious at all why the web app wasn't included. It was clearly removed on purpose [4], but I don't really know what to do to get it into the next Debian release. Doing an \"apt install ntfy\" is going to be quite disappointing for most if the web app doesn't work. Any help or guidance is very welcome![1] https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy[2] https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ntfy[3] https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1420[4] https://salsa.debian.org/ahmadkhalifa/ntfy/-/blob/debian/lat...",

Some are 'glue' packages, eg scripts to manage Debian.  These may not change between releases.Lastly, Debian actually maintains an enormous number of upstream orphaned packages.  In those cases, the version number is the same (sometimes), but with security updates slapped on if required.From my perspective, outside of timely and quick security updates, I have zero desire for a lot of churn.
