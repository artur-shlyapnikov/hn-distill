Everything about their approach — from showing me Condorcet, organising stable chaos, moving forward by measured consensus, and basing everything on hard wrought principles — has had an effect on me in some way, from technical to social and back again.I love this project and the immeasurable impact it has had on the world through their releases and culture.With all my love, g’o xx",

But as expected of Debian the release notes included an easy fix to restore normal /tmp behavior for people and applications that place many small or large files there.https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues....>\"You can return to /tmp being a regular directory by running systemctl mask tmp.mount as root and rebooting.\"I kind of wish the distros had decided on a new /tmpfs (or /tmp/tmpfs, etc) directory for applications to opt-in to using ram-disk rather than replacing /tmp and having to opt-out.",

I only recently found out they not only have a sexual predator as a contributor, but they also invited him to be a speaker at their conference.This is perhaps a controversial opinion, but that is a deal breaker for me. It's one thing to have someone with a criminal history as a contributor. It's another thing entirely to put a vile sexual predator who committed offenses against a minor front and center and have that person speaking on behalf of the project.This project has little credibility with me anymore.",
