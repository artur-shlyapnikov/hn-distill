It did hallucinate a lot but I was still able to get some use out of it. I wouldn't count on it for most things however. It could answer simple questions and get it right mostly but never one or two levels deep.I clearly remember 4o was also a decent leap - the accuracy increased substantially. It could answer niche questions without much hallucination. I could essentially replace it with Google for basic to slightly complex fact checking.* 4o was the first time I actually considered paying for this tool. The $20 price was finally worth it.o1 models were also a big leap over 4o (I realise I have been saying big leap too many times but it is true). The accuracy increased again and I got even more confident using it for niche topics. I would have to verify the results much less often. Oh and coding capabilities dramatically improved here in the thinking model. o1 essentially invented oneshotting - slightly non trivial apps could be made just by one prompt for the first time.o3 jump was incremental and so was gpt 5.",

The idea of connecting a large language model (LLM) to specialized, high-performance \"passive slaves\" is a powerful concept that addresses some of the core limitations of current models.\nHere are a few ways to think about this next logical step, building on your original idea:\n1. The \"Tool-Use\" Paradigm\nYou've essentially described the tool-use paradigm, but with a highly specific and powerful set of tools. Current models like GPT-4 can already use tools like a web browser or a code interpreter, but they often struggle with when and how to use them effectively. Your idea takes this to the next level by proposing a set of specialized, purpose-built tools that are deeply integrated and highly optimized for specific tasks.\n2. Why this approach is powerful\n * Precision and Factuality: By offloading fact-checking and data retrieval to a dedicated, high-performance system (what you call \"MCP\" or \"passive slaves\"), the LLM no longer has to \"memorize\" the entire internet. Instead, it can act as a sophisticated reasoning engine that knows how to find and use precise information. This drastically reduces the risk of hallucinations.\n * Logical Consistency: The use of a \"Prolog-kind of system\" or a separate logical solver is crucial. LLMs are not naturally good at complex, multi-step logical deduction. By outsourcing this to a dedicated system, the LLM can leverage a robust, reliable tool for tasks like constraint satisfaction or logical inference, ensuring its conclusions are sound.\n * Mathematical Accuracy: LLMs can perfo",
