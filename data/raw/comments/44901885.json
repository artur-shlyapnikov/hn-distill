    "textPlain": "Maybe this will be a good way for users to communicate to the LLMs, but I wonder if it would be better for LLMs to generate code in a more disciplined language.  Something like Eiffel with pre/post invariants or Lean/Rocq for provable correctness.  Then a rigorous compiler can check the LLM emitted what it promised.  The verbosity is unpleasant for conventional human programmers, but it's almost a non-issue for the LLM.",

Or is it a stochastic and unpredictable? If Alice publishes her open source project with the specification code, and Bob has access to a slightly different set of models at a later date, will Bob be able to reproduce the same generated artifacts that Alice did?If you _can_ make everything deterministic and well-behaved, does it need to involve AI agents? Or can this effectively turn into an DSL which happens to be English-like, and a code-generation tool?",
