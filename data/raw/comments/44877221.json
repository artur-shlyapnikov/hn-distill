    "textPlain": "If you see \"Trust and Safety\" it is actually a partnership between major tech companies. It provides guidance on how their TOS / community standards should be defined. Twitter was also a member until Elon bought it out. This is where things like policies on misinformation come from (or anything in general really). Every major social media company you can imagine is part of it, Discord, Reddit, Meta, Apple, etc.The part that always concerns me is things like this are ripe for abuse. Whoever controls the partnership potentially controls all major platforms. They'll say you dont have to follow it to the letter, but that doesn't mean some wont.This is also why when reddit changes internal rules Discord follows suit.I am interested in this subject because I've seen Facebook become hostile over the years on specific types of remarks. I actually quit Facebook over its AI moderation, I made a harmless meme / joke comment and it flagged me, and when I appealed, it flagged me. Meanwhile others post much worse and I get dinged for making meme references that harm no one, my what? 50 friends on facebook will read it and not get my reference?I've also seen other platforms shift their policies (a reddit comment section today is a night and day difference from a reddit thread in say 2010).Digital Trust & Safety Partnership website here:https://dtspartnership.org/",

    "textPlain": "I think the model actually cares about where you post though, or at least there's some kind of location based standard.I've used Reddit for ages, but recently received two 'account suspensions' both which misrepresented my remarks, one in which the appeal was ignored, the other in which the response to the appeal was a false claim that the remark was a threat.But both happened very soon after I participated in discussions in /r/ukpolitics. I especially think they want to get rid of discussion concerning the proscription of Palestine Action. I don't think it's somebody from there following my comment feed and reporting things but instead something actually automated and part of Reddit itself, because it was rather fast.",

China censors directly and heavily, eg \"pooh bear\"In the US you are still very much free to insult the president, etc but if you post things deemed to be pro-terrorist or against what the Government wants to promote on social media, it won't go anywhere. Firearms or vaping content during the Biden admin as an example.The current admin has heavily gutted the federal funding and workforce that backed these efforts and issued bulletins to private industry, but I suspect there is still pressure from pseudo-government \"advocates\".",
