    "textPlain": "> What about regression testing, anway?> My feeling is that Microsoft, and other companies too, have relied far too heavily on their beta testers to identify bugs. They expected problems to be surfaced by telemetry and user reports, which are less effort than actual testing.Microsoft used to be better at this (although bugs still escaped regularly), but in 2014, they eliminated the software developer in test role, and software developers roles were supposed to make up the difference. IMHO, there has been an obvious slump in quality since then.Also, the problem with relying on user bug reports, is when it's clear you're not listening to users, users stop providing bug reports. I've been to microsoft user forums and seen long discussion threads where many people have an issue and there's no follow up from Microsoft. When you direct issues to that kind of forum and don't respond there, that's a sign that says you don't care, don't bother to report things.",

There is a noticeable lag in opening the picker, and—unlike 10 where you could immediately start typing to search—on Windows 11 if you start typing before it's fully open, it just types your search text in the focused window and never opens the emoji picker. It just totally cancels it if you type too fast.",

There’s nothing wrong with questioning things, but choosing to believe others are incompetent or malicious is unhealthy.> I find that when I’m annoyed by things like this and actually dig down into it, the feeling evaporates as I come to appreciate all the complexities and challenges. It’s humbling, and next time I get unreasonably annoyed at something I can remember that feeling, and accept that a lot of things are harder than they seem on the surface.This was a nice little coda to the article. I agree with the sentiment that it's not worth running your mood over, but in contrast to the author's experience I often find after digging down that imho malice/indifference/negligence is responsible for bad time I end up having.",

    "textPlain": "I have yet to find a suitable alternative for the W10 emoji picker that works on linux. I like to use emojis as color codes for errors etc in some of my scripts and I find them very useful as location markers since a visual element is always faster to be recognized by the eye than pure plain text. This tool is also useful when you use multiple messaging applications because you share the same \"most used\" emojis panel. It also frustrates me that the W11 emoji picker got downgraded, it's much more limited and has less of a minimalist design (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻",

Seeing the XP emulation on the front page yesterday reminded me how grotesquely slow 10 and 11 are.  Honestly I wonder if you ran one of the old Windows versions on period hardware how it would compare to now.  And then keeping the period hardware but if you swapped to an SSD I bet it would fly.  But maybe it's rose-tinted glasses.Personally I preferred Vista to 7 (7 took away a bunch of nice things).  Even as bad as Windows Me was from a stability point of view, it at least added new features.  I'd be hard-pressed to think of anything that Windows 11 does better than before.",
