If you don't get it in three, you have to be close to the store to unlock the last two. There's also a bingo board that is filled in when you buy a specific drink or pastry, loot boxes when you earn enough points, tasks, and most recently a candy crush clone to earn 10% off a drink.I'll freely admit it works on me. I have changed my schedule to work from the coffee shop just because I didn't guess the word in three turns. However, if this were attached to a national chain I might be less hesitant to participate. It's kinda funny to me that a local \"snooty\" coffee shop has adopted the practices of the oppressors.",

On your account page it shows all the ones you have clicked.The button does nothing: no discount, no deal, nothing. And yet at the end of Meh’s first year they issued a report and said that something like seventeen people had clicked that button every day of that year. That kind of habit is huge for a site like meh.com, and they accomplished it with a silly button that does nothing but show a custom illustration.",
