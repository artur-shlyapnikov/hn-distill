    "textPlain": "Kagi sucks, this is a bad call.Just kidding, I love Kagi and I get a ton of value from it!  I always like the saying that \"the best ideas are obvious in hindsight\", and that is absolutely how I feel about Kagi.  Being able to uprank, downrank, and/or pinning, blacklisting domains is a killer feature, and something that would have been so easy for Google to have done at any time.  Their approach to AI has also been perfect IMHO.  From the beginning they didn't have the models provide answers, but (basically, as far as I can tell) RAGged the results and summarized (and included sources).  I find myself using that feature all the time.  Also the ! support and generally clean interface make for a great UX.  I also very much appreciate their pro-rating and transparent billing, and the prices being pretty reasonable.The search results themselves are also better than Google (in no small part to my own fine-tuning of domains, i.e. downranking/upranking/blacklisting, but even just the vanilla results are better most of the time).  It has been so long since I've had to !g something that I don't even remember the last time.  I do routinely use !gm to open something in google maps though because Apple maps has not been a good experience for me, but I don't fault Kagi for that.If you haven't tried Kagi, you should.  Also play around with the lenses feature while you're at it, cause you can find some cool stuff that way that otherwise doesn't surface in the results.Initial set up to make Kagi the default search engine is a little involved because you have to put your token in the query string, but the instructions are solid and once it's done, it's done.  Very happy customer.",

But their key demographics have long left (and in the case of CBS, are being forced to leave even faster). They won't be back. Yahoo still exists but it's so dead that its last act of relevance was to have an ex-Google exec execute what was essentially a pump-and-dump for the board. Similarly, few people say Xerox any more and just say copy instead. I don't even know how to call a taxi. Uber/Lyft is orders of magnitude better than taxis ever were.The author is just a key demographic leaving Google. I left for Perplexity. My brother sent me a ChatGPT conversation which I asked some follow up questions to. AI is really good, now.So I rarely search anymore. Search was always just a component in me trying to find an answer. Today, it's just a noisy inaccurate distraction.The author won't be going back. I won't be going back.

And if I do come across something spammy, I know that telling Kagi to adjust a site lower (or remove a site from results) is just 2 clicks away.Even though it's a small thing, it's one I encountered with every Google search, manyamnymany times per day. Relieving that is worth more than $10/mo to me. I think that pricing is right, though—if it were more than $10/mo and I likely never would have tried it.The only thing I use Google Search for now is hyperlocal stuff, mostly I expect to interact with  Maps result.

But what is the incentive to create more blogs for them LLM companies to scrape for novel tech? They are great for answering questions about things that are very well documented and understood but the incentive structure that aligns technical bloggers with search is being undermined.In tech, knowledge scales non-linearly. No amount of trivial search can amount to finding excellent technical writing. Most of the stuff LLMs are great at answering are things that an individual can typically figure out already just much more slowly by RTFM (eg: react component, MVC code etc.) However, the LLMs fail at deeply technical or highly novel subjects.I worry LLM usage overtime will create a gap between research papers and engineering as nobody is incentivizeded to write about their implementations/explorations.I am hearing more and more tech-people jumping to Kagi regardless of role (SWE,SRE, PD,DS) which is encouraging.",

    "textPlain": "I dumped DuckDuckGo for Kagi. heh hehSeriously, I haven't used Google in years. I stopped even relying on Google as a decent backup option because it's gotten so-o-o bad. DDG has gotten incrementally worse simply because they're unable to fend off the reams of AI slop taking over everything (and it's also based in large part on Bing's index).I recently tried Kagi now that they have free and lower-cost tiers, and oh wow I can feel the difference. This is like 2010s-era search, and I mean that as a distinct compliment. I signed up and won't look back. The \"Quick Peek\" feature is truly fantastic…it feels like it's some sort of AI but it's simply just a good set of queries with good excerpts of REAL text from REAL links. Bravo!",

    "textPlain": "I'm fine paying for search, but I don't want to use LLMs and therefore I don't want to _pay_ for access to LLMs that I'm not going to use. If Kagi offered a lower cost subscription with zero LLM bullshit then I would happily resubscribe. I'm not holding my breath though, being able to actually find information on the internet is just probably dead forever.",
