    "textPlain": "This model is a LOT of fun. It's absolutely tiny - just a 241MB download - and screamingly fast, and hallucinates wildly about almost everything.Here's one of dozens of results I got for \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\". For this one it decided to write a poem:  +-----------------------+\n  |   Pelican Riding Bike |\n  +-----------------------+\n  |  This is the cat!  |\n  |  He's got big wings and a happy tail.  |\n  |  He loves to ride his bike!  |\n  +-----------------------+\n  |   Bike lights are shining bright.  |\n  |   He's got a shiny top, too!  |\n  |   He's ready for adventure!  |\n  +-----------------------+\n\nThere are a bunch more attempts in this Gist, some of which do at least include an SVG tag albeit one that doesn't render anything: https://gist.github.com/simonw/25e7b7afd6a63a2f15db48b3a51ec...I'm looking forward to seeing people fine-tune this in a way that produces useful output for selected tasks, which should absolutely be feasible.",

    "textPlain": "Hi all, I built these models with a great team. They're available for download across the open model ecosystem so give them a try! I built these models with a great team and am thrilled to get them out to you.From our side we designed these models to be strong for their size out of the box, and with the goal you'll all finetune it for your use case. With the small size it'll fit on a wide range of hardware and cost much less to finetune. You can try finetuning them yourself in a free colab in under 5 minutesFor picking a Gemma size this is a video I recorded for the 1b to 27b sizes earlier this year, 270m being the newest additionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcjrduz_YS8Hacker News Disclaimer\nI really like working at Google so with that; All my opinions here are my own, I'm a researcher so I'll largely focus on technical questions, and I'll share what I can.",

It's a given that benchmark values would be lower than gemma 3n, but having a sense of performance vs size curve and comparison to existing small models is needed",
