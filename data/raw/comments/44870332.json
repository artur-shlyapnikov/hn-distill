    "textPlain": "It's interesting that this is framed in the context of 'foul play' - I wouldn't be surprised if we find out that even in regular play there's often enough head impact to be concerning. I'm actually surprised this would get approved given that it could put the league in an awkward position of trying to argue why you should ignore the very devices it approved. Usually sports organisations like to put a thumb on the scale in these cases [0][0] I could pick many but lets go with the IWF who's largest wikipedia section is the one for corruption - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Weightlifting_Fe...",

So, not just regular head impact it seems.Then mentions that it's an update to the current \"smart mouthguard\" which uses Bluetooth, because with \"the current system the alerts can take several seconds to reach the match day doctor.\". So, it's not just about flagging something illegal but actually goes to match day doctors when the impact is severe. This new one let's people/ref know to wave a doctor over quicker/send them offAt the bottom they added that \"the technology could also help identify instances of foul play.\"",

The players are not wearing helmets, and the refs are OK with using video review (with the videos playing out on the stadium screens) for all to see.  It’s very different from US football or worldwide soccer/football.",
