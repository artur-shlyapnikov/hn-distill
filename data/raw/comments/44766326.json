    "textPlain": "> Jin-su spent most of his time trying to secure fraudulent identities which he could use to apply for jobs. He would first pose as Chinese, and contact people in Hungary, Turkey and other countries to ask them to use their identity in exchange for a percentage of his earnings, he told the BBC.\"If you put an 'Asian face' on that profile, you'll never get a job.\"\nHe would then use those borrowed identities to approach people in Western Europe for their identities, which he'd use to apply for jobs in the US and Europe. Jin-su often found success targeting UK citizens.\"With a little bit of chat, people in the UK passed on their identities so easily,\" he said.Interesting. I was under the impression that most large employers perform basic background checks on new employees?",
