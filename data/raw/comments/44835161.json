    "textPlain": "Hey HN,I am a professional developer who loves building side projects and early adopting AI.After I tried OpenAI Codex, I was impressed. I can write a prompt and get a PR.When Anthropic released Claude Code SDK, I started building AgentWrap to:1. ship from my mobile phone, \n2. ship multiples features in parallel.I personally use and improve the service every day and hope you find it useful too. Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.Denis",
