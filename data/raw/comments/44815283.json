    "textPlain": "The way the narrative around the nuclear bombings of Japan has formed is really upsetting and frankly infuriating. A long article full of impressive and emotive pictures, and the entire acknowledgement that Japan had done anything that might have required bombing them is boiled down to:> The Japanese empire’s bloody march through Asia was over. But the impact on civilians lingered, both in the countries the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces had invaded and at home, where a nuclear Armageddon had come twice.They killed 3,000,000+ people in their invasion of China alone! They butchered people for the sake of butchering them, starved many more, used humans as test subjects like the Nazis, dropped \"plague bombs\" on Manchuria... there's a reason that Korean, Chinese, and Filipino people still often have strong feelings about Japan. Japan has also had a \"struggle\" with coming to terms with their guilt in these matters, avoiding \"small issues\" like memorializing war criminals, and accepting what they did.The article and most accounts focus on the terror and the horror of the bombs, while somehow missing that conventional firebombing (i.e. of Tokyo) was both more deadly and just as horrific. The need to create a specific \"the nuclear attacks were inhuman, inhumane, horrific, special\" is ultimately self-serving and often used as deflection from self-examination.The article and most accounts also ignore why the US government undertook both the conventional and nuclear bombings: Because in the end an estimated 25,000,000 human beings died in the Pacific Theater, in the context of an overall war (all theaters) of more than triple that number. The prospect of continuing to go island-hopping at tremendous cost to human life just so that the Imperial Japanese leadership didn't have to surrender was a non-starter. An alternative existed, strategic bombing, and part of that ended up being nuclear.Another issue with the narrative as written is that it's framed as entirely an attack on c",
