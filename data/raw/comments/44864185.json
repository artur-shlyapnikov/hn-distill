Setting up a VPS where Claude is just asked to go nuts - to the point where you're building a little script to keep Claude humming away - is a really fun idea.This sort of thing is a great demonstration of why I remain excited about AI in spite of all the hype and anti-hype. It's just fun to mess with these tools, to let them get friction out of your way. It's a revival of the feelings I had when I first started coding: \"wow, I really can do anything if I can just figure out how.\"Great article, thanks for sharing!",

That's often what you want though.)> I asked Claude to rename all the files and I could go do something else while it churned away, reading the files and figuring out the correct names.It's got infinite patience for performing tedious tasks manually and will gladly eat up all your tokens. When I see it doing something like this manually, I stop it and tell it to write a program to do the thing I want. e.g. I needed to change the shape of about 100 JSON files the other day and it wanted to go through them one-by-one. I stopped it after the third file, told it to write a script to import the old shape and write out the new shape, and 30 seconds later it was done. I also had it write me a script to... rename my stupidly named bank statements. :-)",

Little of the article is that, but it's still interesting to see the workflow outlined here, and it gives me a few ideas to try more of.However, I disagree that LLMs are anywhere near as good as what's described here for most things I've worked with.So far, I'm pretty impressed with Cursor as a toy.  It's not a usable tool for me, though.  I haven't used Claude a ton, though I've seen co-workers use it quite a bit. Maybe I'm just not embracing the full \"vibe coding\" thing enough and not allowing AI agents to fully run wild.I will concede that Claude and Cursor have gotten quite good at frontend web development generation.  I don't doubt that there are a lot of tasks where they make sense.However, I still have yet to see a _single_ example of any of these tools working for my domain.  Every single case, even when the folks who are trumpeting the tools internally run the prompting/etc, results in catastrophic failure.The ones people trumpet internally are cases where folks can't be bothered to learn the libraries they're working with.The real issue is that people who aren't deeply familiar with the domain don't notice the problems with the changes LLMs make.  They _seem_ reasonable. Essentially by definition.Despite this, we are being nearly forced to use AI tooling on critical production scientific computing code.  I have been told I should never be editing code directly and been told I must use AI tooling by various higher level execs and managers.  Doing so is 10x to 100x slower than making changes directly.  I don't have boilerplate. I do care about knowing what things do because I need to communicate that to customers and predict how changes to parameters will affect output.I keep hearing things described as an \"overactive intern\", but I've never seen an intern this bad, and I've seen a _lot_ of interns.
