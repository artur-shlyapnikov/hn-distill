Setting up a VPS where Claude is just asked to go nuts - to the point where you're building a little script to keep Claude humming away - is a really fun idea.This sort of thing is a great demonstration of why I remain excited about AI in spite of all the hype and anti-hype. It's just fun to mess with these tools, to let them get friction out of your way. It's a revival of the feelings I had when I first started coding: \"wow, I really can do anything if I can just figure out how.\"Great article, thanks for sharing!",

I stopped it after the third file, told it to write a script to import the old shape and write out the new shape, and 30 seconds later it was done. I also had it write me a script to... rename my stupidly named bank statements. :-)",

Little of the article is that, but it's still interesting to see the workflow outlined here, and it gives me a few ideas to try more of.However, I disagree that LLMs are anywhere near as good as what's described here for most things I've worked with.So far, I'm pretty impressed with Cursor as a toy.  It's not a usable tool for me, though.  I haven't used Claude a ton, though I've seen co-workers use it quite a bit. Maybe I'm just not embracing the full \"vibe coding\" thing enough and not allowing AI agents to fully run wild.I will concede that Claude and Cursor have gotten quite good at frontend web development generation.  I don't doubt that there are a lot of tasks where they make sense.However, I still have yet to see a _single_ example of any of these tools working for my domain.  Every single case, even when the folks who are trumpeting the tools internally run the prompting/etc, results in catastrophic failure.The ones people trumpet internally are cases where folks can't be bothered to learn the libraries they're working with.The real issue is that people who aren't deeply familiar with the domain don't notice the problems with the changes LLMs make.  They _seem_ reasonable. Essentially by definition.Despite this, we are being nearly forced to use AI tooling on critical production scientific computing code.  I have been told I should never be editing code directly and been told I must use AI tooling by various higher level execs and managers.  Doing so is 10x to 100x slower than making changes directly.  I don't have boilerplate. I do care about knowing what things do because I need to communicate that to customers and predict how changes to parameters will affect output.I keep hearing things described as an \"overactive intern\", but I've never seen an intern this bad, and I've seen a _lot_ of interns.

But I think perhaps it's better suited to web developmentUsing it for iOS development is interesting. It does produce working output (sometimes!) but it's very hit-or-miss. Recently I gave it a couple hours to build a CarPlay prototype of one of my apps. It was completely unable to refactor the codebase to correctly support CarPlay (even though I passed the entire CarPlay documentation into it). I gave it three attempts at it. Then I intervened and added support for CarPlay manually, following that I added a lot of skeleton code for it to flesh out. Claude was then able to build a prototypeHowever, over the next few days as I tried to maintain the code I ended up rewriting 60% of it because it was not maintainable or correct. (By \"not correct\" I mean it had logic errors and was updating the display multiple times with incorrect information before replacing it with correct information, causing the data displayed to randomly refresh)I also tried getting it to add some new screens to a game I develop. I wanted it to add some of the purchase flows into the app (boring code that I hate writing). It managed to do it with compile errors, and was unable to fix its own build output despite having the tools to do so. Instead of fixing the build errors it caused, Claude Code decided it would manually verify that only its own changes were correct by running `swiftc` on only files that it touched. Which was nonsenseAll that said, there was a benefit in that Claude Code writing all this code and getting something up on the screen motivated me to finally pick up the work and do some of these tasks. I had been putting them off for months and just having the work \"get started\" no matter how bad, was a good kick start",

I was a loyal Cline user until recently because of how good the editor experience was, but the ability for Claude to go off and run for 10+ minutes effectively autonomously, and show me the diffs in realtime is a gamechanger. The token usage has also gotten much more efficient in the last few months. With proper IDE support now I don't see any reason at all to use anything else, especially not the \"credit\" based middle-man providers (Windsurf/Cursor et. al).",

The first big public usages of AI were toys and vastly performed as a sideshow attraction for amused netizens. Maybe we haven't come very far at all, in comparison to the resources spent. It seems like all of the truly impressive and useful applications of this technology are still in specialized private sector work.",
