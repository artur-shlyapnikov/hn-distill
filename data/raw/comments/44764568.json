    "textPlain": "Truly, one of the most original artists of our time. I am among those who think Einstein on the Beach is one of the greatest theatrical works of the twentieth century, but I don't think I ever saw a Wilson piece that didn't completely blow my mind.I seem to recall an interview in which he said that he didn't think many of his works should be revived. I hope that's not true, and that his pieces have a long life in repertory.",

I found it interesting how Wilson's staging seemed to make Glass's music so accessible.",
