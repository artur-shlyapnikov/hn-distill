Based on an estimated US GDP figure of $30 trillion, AI CapEx is expected to amount to 2.08 percent of the US GDP!Do note that peak spending on rail roads eventually amounted to ~20 percent of the US GDP in the 19th century. This means that the ongoing AI CapEx boom has lots of legroom to run before it reaches parity with the rail road boom of that bygone era.",

Right now, everything is propped up on the premise the hyperscalers will grow EPS proportionately to their investment and that ROA is being priced in as a best case scenario (hope) in their share price. Maybe its not ROA at all, maybe its simply FOMO, we keep citing this 'AI Race' as if there is some end objective to 'win' drawing parallels to the nuclear arms race that only resulted in massive wasted CAPEX in decaying nukes sitting in unused bunkers since the cold war. (Not to mention it isn't even clear this arms race played a direct factor in the war beside depleting resources) Everyone is happy right now. Execs get stock bonuses, investors get returns, vendors get contracts. Once this is questioned, and history demonstrates it undoubtedly will be, it will cause a cascading collapse.

    "textPlain": "Althought we know that there is no empirical evidence for trickle down economy, a worst case scenario was that some of the profit would be allocated to be cost of labor and through great economy expansion and regardless of rising inequality and some reskilling, innovation and its effect on the rise of the economy was at least somewhat positive for everybody.This will not be the case anymore. There is no labor restructuring to be made, the lists for the future safe jobs are humorous to say the least. There has been a difficulty in finding skilled labor in sustainable wages for the companies and that has been highlighted as a key blocker for growth. Econony will rise by removing this blocker by AI. Rise of the economy due to AI invalidates old models and trickle down spurious correlations. Rise of the economy through AI directly enables the most extreme inequality and no reflexes or economics experience exists to manage it.There have been many theories for revolutions, social financial ideological and others. I will not comnent on those but I will make a practical observation: It boils down to the ratio of controlers vs controlled. AI also enables an extremely minimal number of controllers through the AI managment  of the flow information and later a large number of drones can keep everyone at bay. Cheaply, so good for the economy.",
