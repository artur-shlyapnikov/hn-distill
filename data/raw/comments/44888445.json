They had an outage like a year ago, and during said outage, all your existing ad blocking stopped working, too, even if you never rebooted during the outage, and even though said blocking is supposed to be performed locally.  I think you can't even get the ad blocking unless you or your ISP pays for the special subscription, either.  (I imagine the thing could have removed all local ad blocking settings and lists during the time it couldn't confirm you're still a paying customer because their cloud was down?)Does anyone know how exactly does Amazon get away with not providing data export for their eero product?  I haven't seen a Blink or Ring exports, either.  The main Amazon dot com does have the export, which has some extensive data you may not think they do collect, but it doesn't cover eero, Blink or Ring.",
