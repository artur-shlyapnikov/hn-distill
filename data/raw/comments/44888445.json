I think you can't even get the ad blocking unless you or your ISP pays for the special subscription, either.  (I imagine the thing could have removed all local ad blocking settings and lists during the time it couldn't confirm you're still a paying customer because their cloud was down?)Does anyone know how exactly does Amazon get away with not providing data export for their eero product?  I haven't seen a Blink or Ring exports, either.  The main Amazon dot com does have the export, which has some extensive data you may not think they do collect, but it doesn't cover eero, Blink or Ring.",

That will send the deletion request to every registered data broker in the state who will then have 45 days to comply. Part of that compliance is sending deletion notifications to everyone downstream that they have shared or sold your data to in the past. The penalty for not responding to a DROP request is going to be $200 a day, per request.Starting in 2028 CA registered data brokers will have to undergo audits to ensure that they have been complying with deletion requests to the fullest extent of the law. Now, maybe only 20% of actual data brokers are registered in California like they are supposed to be, but it's a start.Shameless plug: I'm building a platform to help the data brokers actually delete the data they are supposed to, provide full auditing and accounting for that process, and automate privacy request handling: forgetmenaut.com",
