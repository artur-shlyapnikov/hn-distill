I think first there needs to be a mindset shift in who's responsible for open source.Currently when new vulnerabilities pop up (i.e. xz-utils compromise, log4j shell), people are quick to blame the maintainers for it. Why shouldn't companies instead be responsible for these vulnerabilities?Currently, companies treat open source code as someone else's, so they don't bother to audit, maintain it, or fund it.\nClearly, this is wrong, and reflected in the oss license, which states that code is solely consumer's responsibility.",

Perhaps giving some finite compute to experiment with at little to no cost. Others can donate or are incentivized to provide unused compute.There’s so much unused / underutilized resources out there that it would be a great boon to somehow make that available and further reduce barriers to entry. Aside from that it’s just a really interesting problem that intersects a lot of different areas.",

The article also opens by contrasting open source consumption and contribution. In a certain sense, as the article acknowledges later, I care much much more about government consuming free software, as a neutral platform to avoid lock-in for themselves and the taxpayer, as well as providing an open foundation for integration and letting people use free software if they choose to (and not lock them to iOS and Android, for instance.) That alone is one of the biggest ways they can contribute.  The actual code contribution will come naturally if they do that.",

For example, laravel might get a lot of funding from this.However, the underlying infrastructure libraries, will not get any funding from this, even though they have much more users. For example, libxml2, xzutils, http parser ...You can't build any product off of an infrastructure library, purchasing support doesn't make sense, and there are little bonus features to be made.One way to remedy this, is to have well funded open source projects take ownership of its dependencies.",

This sort of thing happens all the time the in the commercial space.It of course also happens to some extent to open source projects, but usually that results in forks if the demand is high enough. For commercial software, you don't have many options - especially for subscription based licensing, which is pretty much the norm nowadays.",
