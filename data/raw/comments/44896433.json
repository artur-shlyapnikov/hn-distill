    "textPlain": "I would be much more excited in finding ways to fund public infrastructure like Amazon does Prime rather than going the other way around.  If anything, academic open source which is the closest alternative has not really produced much and the production open source that actually works is by and large corporate-sponsored.P.S. The article also opens by contrasting open source consumption and contribution. In a certain sense, as the article acknowledges later, I care much much more about government consuming free software, as a neutral platform to avoid lock-in for themselves and the taxpayer, as well as providing an open foundation for integration and letting people use free software if they choose to (and not lock them to iOS and Android, for instance.) That alone is one of the biggest ways they can contribute.  The actual code contribution will come naturally if they do that.",
