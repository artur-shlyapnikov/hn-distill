    "textPlain": "I agree that open source infrastructure needs to be funded. I think first there needs to be a mindset shift in who's responsible for open source.Currently when new vulnerabilities pop up (i.e. xz-utils compromise, log4j shell), people are quick to blame the maintainers for it. Why shouldn't companies instead be responsible for these vulnerabilities?Currently, companies treat open source code as someone else's, so they don't bother to audit, maintain it, or fund it.\nClearly, this is wrong, and reflected in the oss license, which states that code is solely consumer's responsibility.",

    "textPlain": "I would be much more excited in finding ways to fund public infrastructure like Amazon does Prime rather than going the other way around.  If anything, academic open source which is the closest alternative has not really produced much and the production open source that actually works is by and large corporate-sponsored.P.S. The article also opens by contrasting open source consumption and contribution. In a certain sense, as the article acknowledges later, I care much much more about government consuming free software, as a neutral platform to avoid lock-in for themselves and the taxpayer, as well as providing an open foundation for integration and letting people use free software if they choose to (and not lock them to iOS and Android, for instance.) That alone is one of the biggest ways they can contribute.  The actual code contribution will come naturally if they do that.",

Could come across a bit like an unintentional bait and switch from the other point of view though, these projects love to see adoption but then require funding to maintain? Maybe setting the project up more commercially that then self funds the open source platform like Laravel is a more sustainable model?",
