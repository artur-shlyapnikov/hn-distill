And since when has that ever worked?  well it worked until about the 70s and then we roughly flat line for about 30 years and since 98, its been nothing but down hill from there (if you dought this, calculate the standard of living: nominal gdp per capita or median wages / case-shiller housing index).  by all means try but it's not going to work.There's two sides to personal finance: what you earn and what you spend.  earning more, on a wholistic countrywide scale, simply isn't possible anymore (if the last 50 years has taught us anything).The answer lies in allowing the economy to make life more cost effective (removing regulations that force housing costs to be high, making more land available for living, thus driving down it's costs, etc.).  The answer lies in controlling costs and spending, both in the personal life and for government.",
