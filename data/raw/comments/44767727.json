I almost never see it in the cities these days (billboards have taken over), but back in my parents' villages, a lot of older painted advertisements (like Maha Cement) are still there on the walls that run past the main street.On a side note, I have an HTTP200 license plate and I want to get some nice Indian truck style lettering saying HORN <HTTP200> PLEASE around it :)",

    "textPlain": "I've always observed a curious thing within India regarding the Devnagari (Hindi) and Latin (English) scripts. Essentially all English words are always written in Devnagari, but it's rarely the other way around. For example it is much more likely to see इंग्लिश टू हिंदी than \"angrezi se hindi\".My personal theory is that this is because you can make every sound you hear in English using the Devnagari script, but not the other way around.",

They start with a yellow rectangle, and then paint black lines as negative space, eventually bringing out yellow letters out.",
