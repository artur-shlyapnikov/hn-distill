    "textPlain": "A while back, I watched a YT video of someone making a large electret.  Reading this makes me really want to make one for myself.An electret is an item that presents a permanent static charge.  It is like a permanent magnet.  Has an enduring charge polarity.The only use of an electret I know of is the electret microphone.  And those use a very small electret.In the video, the author made a large one. Hockey puck sized.  He used some type of nylon. (I think I remember it right...)",

    "textPlain": "Good opportunity to share this life hack: I used to end up with a mess almost every time I used my coffee grinder, much like the picture in the article. Eventually I learned that this only happens with very dry beans. Adding a few tiny drops of water before grinding is enough to get rid of it pretty much completely. Since making coffee already involves water it’s as easy as dipping a finger and then running it through the beans.",

Is there a triboelectric effect between two conductors? How? Why wouldn't the distribution of electrons even out in a pair of conductors, or do they mean non conducting metals?\nAnd I imagine someone has looked at triboelectric effects between crystals of varying materials - does anyone know?",
