The reference check should be the last thing after there is a conditional offer with at least a comp range provided. The reasoning I have been given is that they would need to see what the references say in order to determine the correct role or comp range. So when I suggest they provide the comp range assuming I have good references and they decline to, that's a nonstarter and demonstrates they are acting in bad faith IMO. This is clearly the type of negotiation tactic where you want your counter party to invest as much as possible (by providing their references) so you have more leverage.",

Kinda applies to a lot of his points - some of these aren’t unequivocally bad hiring practices, they are just polarizing or a matter of pros and cons.Hot take: a lot of job openings for highly specialized skills or from small-medium sized businesses are not posted with specific salary bands in mind, just “as much as it takes to get a great candidate, but not more than their expected value”. In some cases you could legitimately be open to candidates costing anywhere between $80k and $500k - it looks weird to list a job that way, would you do it? Maybe it turns some candidates off, maybe it prevents scaring off candidates who would be great fits and accept the offer. Maybe it’s not worth getting upset about",

Unless you are hiring highschool graduates directly, you have other means of finding out how good candidates are. If a highschool report card tells you more about a candidate than your own interview process, you need to fire everyone involved with that process.2) Highschool performance is highly correlated with a bunch of causes that are very undesirable things to proxy-measure in your hiring process.In the UK, where Canonical and Mark hail from, high school performance is a statistical proxy for class (wealth). In the US, it is a statistical proxy for ethnicity as well. You need to be careful with such measures, as selecting job candidates based on class or race is both unethical and commonly illegal.Again consider that these are high school results. A person who is born to unlucky schooling opportunities can still compensate for the learning they were deprived of by working harder in college/university or their formal career after that.",
