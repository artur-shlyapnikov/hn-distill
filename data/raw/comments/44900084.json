    "textPlain": "Until you've worked at a job where you're genuinely excited to get up every morning and hack, it's very hard to empathize with this sentiment. Doubly so because employers compelling enough to make employees passionate about their jobs often exploit this and have extremely substandard working conditions (exhibit A: academia). Despite that, once you've been genuinely passionate about a job, it's very hard to see the world any other way.",

    "textPlain": "While I understand the sentiment, its often not that black and white.I was in a similar situation a few years ago, with one company doing something novel and \"better for humanity\" v/s just another saas that paid more. While I was leaning towards the former, what really bothered me was 1) their equity structure was quite pitiful, lower than industry standard and 2) They weren't flexible with remote work. Now, I completely understand if the base compensation is smaller than usual, if the equity is higher. The way the equity was structured, it just seemed like in the off chance that the company did become very successful, almost all the benefits would accrue to the founder. And if they weren't offering the best comp, benefits in other areas (like remote flexibility) would have really helped even things out.I am very mindful of who gets the \"benefits of my passion\". Because this is how a lot of people get free labor from idealistic engineers. So while I would have preferred the work of the former, I ended up going with the latter; and I don't regret it.",

I find passion in all things extremely overrated, what you need is love, steady, consistent and reassuring. And don't forget sentiments don't pay bills, money does.",

With the possible exception of those folks who live in HCOL areas - most software engineers I know have a comfortable enough salary to remove obstacles to happiness. Many do choose to prioritize money over other factors - but I often see it used for more hedonistic/luxury purposes - which IMO isn't really conducive to long-term happiness.Time is our most valuable resource - 40 hours a week is often more time than people spend with their families and friends during the week, so making sure that that time isn't just a means to an end is something I've tried to prioritize in my life",

    "textPlain": "I'm not sure I totally agree.Personal profit maximization only works to a point - for example, if you get too old, sick or the system rejects you early and curtails or limits your ability to make money.I don't disagree that money gives you options, but, far too many people wait until they have enough money to give back.If you give back while you are working (e.g. balancing working for profit vs working for nonprofit, altruistic reasons, etc.) - that's awesome.  The challenge there is maximizing the good you can do if you're giving too much time and energy to your profit maximization.At some point, someone has do physically do the needed good work.For myself, the calculus has shifted.  I personally decided I cannot wait until I have enough money, or I am maximizing my profit, to go out and help people.I also cannot wait until I am physically or mentally unable to help beyond financial contributions.  Also, I cannot afford to work in the current system that drains everything from you and leaves you no energy or time left, only money (if that).Regarding the inherent maximum scaling limits of one person- I would challenge your thinking.Power laws of networks may demonstrate that helping a small number of the right people might be enough to unleash the butterfly effect or play into ongoing changes.Also, the physical limits of humanity on one person apply to a billionaire as much as a person with little money.  I'm not saying a billionaire, millionaire, or person with significant finances isn't more mobile/capable, but it's not a given.I am for reasonable profit and balance.  There is nothing inherently wrong with maximizing profit if someone chooses.But if we all spend our time on maximizing profit, there still, for the time being and probably well into the future, still needs to be boots on the ground doing work that is not for profit.",
