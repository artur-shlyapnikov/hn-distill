This is just another option for situations where you need something more readable for non-technical users or when you want to store schedules in a database and display them in plain language. There are valid use cases for both approaches.The goal is provide a format that’s user-friendly while still being precise enough for developers and systems to rely on. It’s especially useful for things like configurable schedules in apps, admin dashboards, or any context where end users and developers need to share the same language.I appreciated the feedback and comments.",
