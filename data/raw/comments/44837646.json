Anyway, I think it'll be really interesting to see how this settles out over the next few weeks, and how that'll contrast to what the 24-hour response has been.My own very naive and underinformed sense: OpenAI doesn't have other revenue paths to fall back on like Google does. The GPT5 strategy really makes sense to me if I look at this as a market share strategy. They want to scale out like crazy, in a way that is affordable to them. If it's that cheap, then they must have put a ton of work in to some scaling effort that the other vendors just don't care about as much, whether due to loss-leader economics or VC funding. It really makes me wonder if OpenAI is sitting on something much better that also just happens to be much, much more expensive.Overall, I'm weirdly impressed because if that was really their move here, it's a slight evidence point that shows that somewhere down in their guts, they do really seem to care about their original mission. For people other than power users, this might actually be a big step forward.",

It's not obvious that this would happen or would even be possible from this kind of architecture. It's obviously doing something deep here.As an aside, I think it's funny that the AI Doomer crowd ignores image and video AI models when it comes to AI models that will enslave humanity. It's not inconceivable that a video model would have a better understanding of the world than an LLM. So perhaps it would grow new capabilities and sprout some kind of intent. It's super-intelligence! Surely these models if trained long enough will deduce hypnosis or some similar kind of mind control and cause mass extinction events.I mean, the only other explanation why LLMs are so scary and likely to be the AI that kills us all is that they're trained on a lot of sci-fi novels so sometimes they'll say things mimicking sentient life and express some kind of will. But obviously that's not true ;-)",
