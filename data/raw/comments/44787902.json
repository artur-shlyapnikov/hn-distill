It looks like pending submissions have permalinks that say \"Timelapse will be available after this is drawn\", but there's no way to discover permalinks for completed submissions (or the in-progress one).",

Some combination of gravity or pneumatics to drive it. So a scan line would flush out one end and refill from the other.  Then scale it up to a stadium size unit with bowling ball pixels.I guess a challenging part would be proper timing to recycling the colors back into their appropriate supply channels. And also introducing some kind of damping to quiet it down and reduce the wear and tear on the pixels.On the other extreme, you could go active matrix and have blocks that simply rotate in place to show different face colors based on some solenoid/servo action.",

I feel like it should be able to do a whole column pretty quickly with some optimizations. If the device that turns a block could do so without needing x-axis alignment to change, then you could do a whole column pretty quickly. Or perhaps it'd be better to do rows instead of columns, since the y-axis alignment shouldn't need to change with the current device. As for the block-turning device itself, I think some sort of thing that rotates would speed things up since you wouldn't need to reset, I think. I bet a manufacturing automation specialist could get this thing cruising...BTW I love that you initially went with a very direct e-ink analog with the balls!",
