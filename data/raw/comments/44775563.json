    "textPlain": "Let me share a personal story. Back in 2014 when I was working at Cloudflare on DDoS mitigation I collaborated a lot with a collage - James (Jog). I asked him loads of questions, from \"how to login to a server\", via \"what is anycast\" to \"tell me how you mitigated this one, give me precise instructions you've run\".I quickly realised that these conversations had value outside the two of us - pretty much everyone else onboarded had similar questions. Some subjects were about pure onboarding friction, some were about workflows most folks didn't know existed, some were about theoretical concepts.So I moved the questions to a public (within company) channel, and called it \"Marek's Bitching\" - because this is what it was. Pretty much me complaining and moaning and asking annoying questions. I invited more London folks (Zygis), and before I knew half of the company joined it.It had tremendous value. It captured all the things that didn't have real place in the other places in the company, from technical novelties, through discussions that were escaping structure - we suspected intel firmware bugs, but that was outside of any specific team at the time.Then the channel was renamed to something more palatable - \"Marek's technical corner\" and it had a clear place in the technical company culture for more than a decade.So yes, it's important to have a place to ramble, and it's important to have \"your own channel\" where folks have less friction and stigma to ask stupid questions and complain. Personal channels might be overkill, but a per-team or per-location \"rambling/bitching\" channel is a good idea.",

Assigned channels where you are expected to post your random thoughts feels utterly dystopian to me.In my experience, \"rambling\" channels build up organically... as you have a thought, you share it with someone relevant, not just drop it into a channel and see who reads it. Over time, small group chats evolve naturally, and assuming everyone has communications skills, topics that become relevant to the whole team are then shared with the whole team.I agree that such discussions are healthy, maybe even required, for a functional remote team. But let people organize themselves - don't prescribe specific methods that teams must follow. The last thing we need is a formal framework of how to have organic discussions.",

Like people are going in random directions not rowing together. I don't think this is true of course -- people are just sharing inspiration and ideas. But in some places / cultures just rambling on slack can be dangerous and put a target on your back. You can be labeled as \"distracting\" by these leaders that feel threatened / worried about the perception the team is not executing on their marching orders.Somehow this is more embarrassing to this leader than random hallway conversations you'd have in a regular office environment. So these leaders have an especially hard time in a remote environment.

People were often hesitant to ask questions they perceived as 'dumb' in the group chat, and definitely unwilling to post anything seen as complaining/moaning about problems. We created a second chat without any managers in it, with a description clarifying it was a dumping ground for questions and comments that didn't fit in other chats. It sees a small but steady flow of use, mostly questions that people probably should know, but can't remember the answer/process of the top of their head, and the occasional slightly less-than-professional complaint or criticism about a service/tool/process. My favourite part is that I can actually discuss things in there - in the main chat, once the question is answered/problem is solved, if we keep chatting about it it's seen as clutter/distraction.

I wrote the notes using QOwnNotes, utilizing its Git integration. So, when someone had a question for which I already had the answer, I could simply share my notes, or create/update a node and share it.The names of the notes were straightforward and easy to follow, such as:- aws.md- azure.md- kubernetes.md- staging.md- production.md- useful-commands.md (jq, sed, base64, etc)My teammates used this resource frequently.
