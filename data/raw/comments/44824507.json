Why are we trusting it to fly planes?”While i sympathize, the world does rely on high quality 30+ year old software. I think it's time, as an industry, to stop seeing software as disposable and start designing for longevity.",

They work fine when everything goes as planned, but the minute something breaks or a storm happens, everything cascades into a steaming pile of shit.In the case of the airlines, competitive market forces previously provided some incentive to invest in reliability but so many airline mergers have been allowed to happen that there's effectively no airline competition in the US any more.",
