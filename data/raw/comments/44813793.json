    "textPlain": "I used windows for so long, I can't stand it now.  It feels like it is actively fighting / pointed AT ME and not for me.In many ways windows was a core part of my life with \"computers\".  The old windows 95 start me up commercial still makes me nostalgic / gets me excited: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0AJM6HMYjMFor a long time Windows allowed me enough customization to get it out of my way and to work FOR my use case.  Changes might be good or bad with windows over the years, but it felt like someone was thinking about the user respectfully as a person who wanted to get things done.  But no longer, I don't know who that start menu is for, not me, anyone?, the settings never sticking ... Windows feels like crappy adware pointed AT me now, they don't care about me doing what I want ... I ran to Apple and haven't looked back.",
