I knew it was AI from the start.It was just that when I got done with it, I realized that I had talked at a computer for ~45 minutes. And, yet again, I was going to be ghosted by the company (I was), and that I was never going to get those 45 minutes back. That was time I could have used to apply for another job, or cook, or sleep, or exercise, or spend time with family. But no, like an idiot, I talked at a bot for that time for literally no reason.Like, sure maaaaybe the company is going to use it as a screen for 'real' people. But the odds that it's not just another hoop they have for you to jump through are nil. If they send an AI 'interview' at you, that's the exact same as an email requesting yet more portfolio submissions. Pointless.",

Screen out obvious robo-applications, you know them when you see them just like you know spam email from the subject line alone.Hint: if you're an insurance or financial services company in Chicago and getting applications from people with a degree from Stanford and 10 years of amazing experience at FAANG companies, they are fakes.Hire the first candidate that has acceptable experience and interviews well. Check their references, but you don't need to consider hundreds or even dozens of people. Most people are average and that's who you're most likely going to hire no matter what you do.Your job is also nothing very special. Have some humility. Very few companies need to be hiring the top 1% type of person, and your company is almost certainly of no interest to those people anyway.",

One thing that's incredibly important about reaching the interview-stage of a job application has been that there is a parity, or even an imbalance favoring the candidate, in human time usage. The company's people (often multiple people at once) have to spend time with the candidate to conduct the interview, so there are stakes for scheduling an interview. The company is investing something into that interaction, so you as a candidate can have some faith that your time is being valued. In the very least, your 45 minute interview is valued at 45*n minutes of company labor for each interviewer.Admitting right off the bat that you're going to waste the time of 90% of your applicants without these stakes is just wildly disrespectful.",

    "textPlain": "Hi everyone,I'm building an AI recruitment platform and your comments really resonated with  me - they really show why the current approach is broken.We actually created this mess by making applications too easy - technology removed friction in the hiring process and now people click apply to jobs without even reading the JD.Worst still with genAI people that may not be a good fit for the roles they apply, use AI to tweak their CVs to match the job descriptions and become a good fit on paper.The results is that companies get flooded with irrelevant applications and respond with more friction, whether that is more screening rounds, more interviewing or AI interviews that add the friction back.We're trying to solve this by adding good friction instead of bad friction. The AI should be working for candidates too, not just extracting value from them.\nWould love your thoughts on what would actually make an AI interview worthwhile from a candidate perspective.",

I interviewed a candidate for a cyber security position, and it became painfully clear by the end that I was just talking to a ChatGPT proxy the entire time. He wouldn't remember key concepts or technologies when asked, only to \"remember\" a few minutes later and give a stellar response to the original question. It's an AI arms race... I'm inclined to just regress back to in-person interviews, paper resumes delivered by-hand, etc.",
