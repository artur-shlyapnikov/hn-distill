Think FAANG, famous hedge fund, popular data analytics platform, and defense. 4 different industries. Job market's not the best, but it's also not that bad if you have 5 YOE+. Offers were good, ~$50-100K over my current pay.So many people are using AI during the interviews to cheat, as long as you don't use AI and are good at leetcode, probably not that hard to snag an offer. I also interview people at a FAANG, and #1 reason to reject people these days is AI use. If you don't use AI and can leetcode and system design, you're pretty solid and will stand out from other half-baked candidates.",

Instead of prices dropping, inventory just dried up.Shows how silly I am for thinking I could time the market.",

In small town America, the problem isn't a lack of housing stock, it's that it is hard to afford it with few good paying jobs.  In big city America, the problem isn't lack of jobs, it's that it is hard to find a job which pays enough for you to afford the limited housing stock.I think this is a large reason behind the polarization in America today.  We aren't all facing the same aspect of this imbalance.I was hoping that the work-from-home movement was going to help with this, but RTO seems to be in full swing.  So, I think our best bet would be to stop incentivizing the concentration of job creation.  Absent a fix, we will have to wait a few decades for the imbalance to even out.",
