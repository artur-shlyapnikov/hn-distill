There is no analog component in it.Furthermore, if by digital you mean online distribution, well, you aren't buying media by definition. You're downloading bits from a wire (or radio wave) and storing it on your own physical media.Among the general public, there is rampant terminology abuse and devaluing of what the word \"digital\" means - it is in contrast to \"analog\", not in contrast to physical, non-electronic, non-online, etc.",

Or delaminate themselves from old age...Enclosed discs like Minidisc solve most of those, but still die from age.Hope they can perfect those \"laser points in glass cubes\" media someday",
