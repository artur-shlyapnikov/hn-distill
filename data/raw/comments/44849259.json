    "textPlain": "I'd say the article is largely correct, but I have at least one nitpick:> ‘How do you burn a CD?’ It’s something that was common for us growing up, but that’s knowledge that’s being lost as everything is sort of transitioning to digital.”This paragraph is using a colloquial but wrong definition of the word \"digital\" - it seems to mean \"online audio/video distribution\" in this context.This is wrong because CDs, by definition, hold digital data. Moreover, some of us who are old enough remember the transition from unapologetically analog audio media - vinyl records and magnetic cassette tape - to digital, optical compact discs. That was the real transition to digital, not the transition from digital physical media to digital online downloads (both are still digital).Digital is a word that contrasts with analog - where analog means infinite variation, no resistance to noise, and imperfect copies. Digital simply means being composed of integers, and it implies finite information and allows perfect copies.Digital does not imply electronic, new and high-tech, virtual, or communications-based (as opposed to transporting matter-based recording media).",

They like streaming and watch whatever is put on their home screen. Tons of people watched Electric State, Red Notice, The Tomorrow War. Citadel got a season 2.",

    "textPlain": "> I refuse to buy digital only media.DVDs are digital-only media - \"Digital Versatile Disc\". There is no analog component in it. The disc stores data digitally.Furthermore, if by digital you mean online distribution, well, you aren't buying media by definition. You're downloading bits from a wire (or radio wave) and storing it on your own physical media.Among the general public, there is rampant terminology abuse and devaluing of what the word \"digital\" means - it is in contrast to \"analog\", not in contrast to physical, non-electronic, non-online, etc. For example, you can make digital logic gates out of mechanical LEGO; you can deliver digital data on floppy disks via sneakers.",

    "textPlain": "Optical disc media is pretty great, if only they didn't scratch so easily... Or get completely destroyed if something sticks to the label side and you try to pull it off... Or delaminate themselves from old age...Enclosed discs like Minidisc solve most of those, but still die from age.Still hope they can perfect those \"laser-created point clouds in glass cubes\" media someday",
