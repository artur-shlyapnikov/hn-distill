    "textPlain": "This demo was so cool.  There were lots of alternative OSes out there back then that felt very impressive.Linux at the time was cool too but less polished than now.  Lots of people were on the Win 9x series, which wasn't amazing - and Mac OS X was not yet fully baked.These other OSes (QNX, BeOS) felt polished, amazingly fast - and slightly alien.  The main sad thing from my perspective was that I couldn't get them online (my machine had a winmodem and nobody had open source drivers for those for ages).",
