Lots of people were on the Win 9x series, which wasn't amazing - and Mac OS X was not yet fully baked.These other OSes (QNX, BeOS) felt polished, amazingly fast - and slightly alien.  The main sad thing from my perspective was that I couldn't get them online (my machine had a winmodem and nobody had open source drivers for those for ages).",
