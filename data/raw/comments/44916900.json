    "textPlain": "I would turn this on its head: it's not clear what the value in it being closed would be.AMD make CPUs (and other silicon products).  The more people who can take the software required to initialise those CPUs and put it to new and novel uses (some of which are going to be open source) the more CPUs they can sell.  One imagines there would also be benefits in just getting your code and documentation out there in the open, with respect to having less NDAs and support legwork to have to slog through with customers who buy a lot of your silicon.  If the code is open, they can probably just use it.",
