A lot of my google search usage now is something like:> \"what is the type of wrench called for getting up into tight spaces\"> AI search gives me an overview of wrench types (I was looking for \"basin wrench\")> new search \"basin wrench amazon\"> new search \"basin wrench lowes\"> maps.google.com \"lowes\"Notably, the information I was looking for was general knowledge. The only people \"losing out\" here are people running SEO-spammish websites that themselves (at this point) are basically hosting LLM-generated answers for me to find. These websites don't really need to exist now. I'm happy to funnel 100% of my traffic to websites that are representing real companies offering real services/info (ship me a wrench, sell me a wrench, show me a video on how to use the wrench, etc).",

I was once busy with something so I asked my partner if he could look up something for me, he confidently shared a screenshot of an AI response from Google. It of course was completely wrong and I had to do my own searching anyways (annoyingly needing to scroll past and ignore the AI response that kept trying to tell me the same wrong information).We have to remember that google is incentivized to keep people on Google more. Their ability to just summarize stuff instead of getting people off of google as quickly as possible is a gold mine for them, of course they are going to push it as hard as possible.",

Otherwise I'm going to double check with an article/credible sourceif anything, I think aimode from google has made it easier to find direct sources for what I need. A lot of the times, I am using AI for \"tip of the tongue\" type searches. I'll list a lot of information related to what I am trying to find, and the aimode does a great job of hunting it down for meultimately though, I do think some old aspects of google search are dying - some good, some bad.Pros: don't fee the need to sift through blog spam, I don't need to scroll past paid search results, I can avoid the BS part of an article where someone goes through their entire life story before the actual content (I'm talking things like cooking website)Cons: Google is definitely going to add ads to this tool at some point, some indie creators on the internet will have a harder time getting their name out.my key takeaway from all this is that people will only stop at your site if they think your site will have something to offer that the AI can't offer. and this isn't new. people have been steeling blog content and turning into videos for ever. people will steel paid tutorials and release the content for free on a personal site. people will basically take content from site-X and repost in a more consumable format on site-Y. and this kind of theft is so obvious and no one liked seeing the same thing reposted a 1000 times.
