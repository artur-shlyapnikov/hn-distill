What am I paying for aside from being upsold?)- Quality and availability of captions, audio description and any other media accessibility options[1] https://www.escapistmagazine.com/valves-gabe-newell-says-pir...",

I was very excited about it, I was on their email list for years, waiting for the announcement. As I got the email that they are available, after work literally the first thing I did was to grab my credit card, and subscribe.I found 4-6 movies I wanted to watch, but when I saw that they had Godfather 1 and 3 without 2, I had a good laugh. Then I watched all the Archer episodes they had, and tried to find something interesting for 2 more days before I cancelled my (still trial) account.Though I stopped watching movies some years ago, until than I used to watch them on the same old pre-netflix way.Of course I have heard that they have spent many billions on content since then, I'm sure they have some interesting stuff... but that came way too late for me.Maybe I'm getting old, lol",

I don’t even know which one(s).Quite frankly, I’m tired of my Verizon plan trying to cram Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ and crap down my throat, I’m tired of Walmart trying to cram Paramount+ at me with Walmart+. However, the market of ‘average (dumb) people’ seems to love this concept as “little extras” that eventually cause scope creep to their bill over time (and we all lose as a result).",
