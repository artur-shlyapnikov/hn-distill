Certainly not limited by opaque \"licensing deals\" between various companies.2. Highest resolution/bitrate/quality that was available at the time of the work's original release.3. No arbitrary device/OS limitations.4. Can watch/listen/download from any location on earth with sufficient bandwidth.I didn't even mention that it's free or that there are no ads, because that's pretty much the least important attribute to me. If any company came out with a service that offered those four points, I'd probably be willing to pay a lot for it. How much? Who knows, we don't know how much this is worth because nobody is even trying to offer it.",

    "textPlain": "Yeah, because you pay for the thing and you still can't watch it!Last year they brought Andor to Hulu and every time I played it on my brand new LG TV, the video would be completely green while I could hear the audio underneath. It only happened to Andor because apparently they had some super special DRM, which ostensibly would restrict people who weren't authorized from viewing it, but had the effect of also preventing authorized people from viewing as well. So in the end, they can't even satisfy willing customers who have their wallets open. Of course they're going to turn to piracy.Of course, the rights holders got my money and as far as they're concerned, their DRM move was great for the bottom line.",
