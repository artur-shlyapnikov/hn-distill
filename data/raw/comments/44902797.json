That was still 10x cheaper than the alternative.However, 15 years later, those numbers exceed or are the same as CATV costs combined with all the streaming/smart device headaches.All we did was change the pipe. The providers didn't change except for consolidation and erosion of policy, both of which lead to worse outcomes for consumers.",

Then I watched all the Archer episodes they had, and tried to find something interesting for 2 more days before I cancelled my (still trial) account.Though I stopped watching movies some years ago, until than I used to watch them on the same old pre-netflix way.Of course I have heard that they have spent many billions on content since then, I'm sure they have some interesting stuff... but that came way too late for me.Maybe I'm getting old, lol",
