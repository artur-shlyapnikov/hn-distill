    "textPlain": "Amazing read that resonated with me deeply.It's not about the boat or the cloud. Yes, they are self-imposed restrictions, but not the actual point the author is trying to make. The message I got from the text was that all these modern systems we use hurt the preservability of software. The text was about the author's journey in finding a solution for preserving their software for generations to come. A solution that if everything is lost, the runtime can be recreated easily so that the actual software can be run again.This is something that I have been thinking about myself a lot and it was interesting to see that the thought-process has been similar with LISP, Oberon, Smalltalk, Forth etc.It's like a carpenter creating his own tools before building a dining room table.",

    "textPlain": "I believe the author writes code as an artistic outlet. They use the word beauty/beautiful 12 times, the word love 8 times, and little (in a cute diminutive way) 10 times. The expresses a relationship with coding that most people don't have. It would be like an author expressing love for a pencil. Some may agree, but many would say \"its just a pencil, the words are what matter.\" In a similar way programmers may say \"its just a language, the features are what matter.\" Even then, Forth is chosen in the end for completely stylistic reasons.Even the nostalgia factor for choosing a Forth is contrived. There are plenty of portable, modern languages that will likely be runnable for decades. Lua is embeddable and will likely be put into new systems for decades, and can run on low power hardware. But Forth is ancient. Its like learning calligraphy. Either you are in a niche, or you just love doing it. But no one uses it for the daily correspondences, they have messaging apps now.I do agree that everything being connected to the cloud definitely excludes people and places. And that place may be anytime in the future. But you can combat this with more modern solutions.",

    "textPlain": ">When your connection to the internet fails and that the software locks up, that skill that you thought was yours was actually entirely owned by someone, and can be taken away.There's a middle ground between locally installed software that fails as soon as you don't have an internet connection for the phone home, and locally installed software that can be used totally unplugged. You can stick a countdown timer within the software that allows 7, 30, 90 etc days of consecutive offline interactivity before the user needs to phone home again. Heck, if you really wanted to, you could sell copies or subscriptions to that software at varying price points depending on how many days the user expects to need - if it's a feature people want, it's a feature you can price in.Why isn't this model more common? Mm, plenty of reasons. You need to implement pretty sophisticated techniques under the hood to deter software crackers, for one, which aren't required when you make an API call every sixty seconds to an Azure Function. For two the modal human mind really hates middle grounds of this sort. I actually suspect that some \"online-only\" local software implements something like this under the hood, and just doesn't advertise it, or perhaps gates it being being an enterprise feature. (I have unfortunately learned firsthand that advertising my software as \"works up to 30 days off-grid\" gets considerably more ire than \"ah, sorry, it does require an internet connection, everything's in the cloud these days, you know how it is\".)But probably the most common reason is simply that most people don't need it! Most regular people aren't using software at all when they go off grid.",
