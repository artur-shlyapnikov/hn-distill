The stuff in the article (GNOME 48, KDE Plasma 6.3, python 3.13, etc.) have cool new features for sure, but it’s not like they were created by Debian.That’s not a knock on the distro.  Debian is great.  It’s just a strange state of affairs.",

Up to 50% total sounds like it might bring unexpected and unwelcome RAM usage spikes to the 1-2GB RAM servers.Did they also tweak default swappinness to accomodate for the change and reduce SSD wear?",
