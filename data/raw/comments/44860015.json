We could definitely write a lot more features if our users didn't point out the ways that what we were doing wasn't quite right or didn't fit with the problem we thought we were solving.I can imagine doing the business part, regulatory part or hard tech part of a startup in stealth mode - but what would does it mean to ship features in stealth mode?",

I worked out a schedule that gave me six nights of sleep across seven days. It meant waking up at stranger and stranger times as the week went on, and getting some odd looks from my roommates when I emerged from my room. But in the end, it was totally worth it. I was waking up well-rested and ready to tackle those extra-long days.The effort paid off 100%. Not only did I make the deadline, but my paper was accepted as well. A year later, that same paper helped me get into my PhD program of choice.It’s funny how these short bursts of intense effort can sometimes have such a big impact.Best of luck with your side hustle!",
