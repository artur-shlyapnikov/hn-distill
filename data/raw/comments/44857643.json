    "textPlain": "> Together with a few other optimizations, these tweaks yielded over 1,000mi in increased range—enough that we could now afford a remarkable passenger cabin without sacrificing fuel efficiency or range.Honestly, the way the narrative reads, they're still sacrificing 1,000mi of range in the interests of an improved cabin experience.  They've just  found an optimisation that enables them to reach a net neutral state.Given we're effectively talking about fuel efficiency here, it's hard to imagine airlines wanting an improved cabin vs less fuel consumption.  All the incentives are on them already to meet a \"barest minimum\" cabin experience that they can get away with, because every bit of luxury costs them in numbers of passengers, and fuel costs.",

    "textPlain": "> We can literally define an airplane parametrically in a configuration file and press a button. In a matter of minutes we have a complete quick-and-dirty analysis of how the whole aircraft performs—as mkBoom flies the aircraft through a full simulated mission (takeoff, climbout, acceleration, cruise, descent, landing). Overnight, mkBoom can run higher-fidelity simulations for a more exact understanding of performance.Awesome stuff! Allows large scale exploration across all dimensions of plane design to jointly optimize all components and their interactions.",

    "textPlain": "> XB-1 is the world’s first independently-developed supersonic jet, breaking the sound barrier for the first time in January, 2025. It was designed, built, and flown successfully by a team of just 50 peopleThis is a great headline and very impressive. However, it’s also somewhat puzzling to see the company spend so much investment money to build a small prototype plane that doesn’t resemble a commercial airliner in any way, break the sound barrier 6 times, retire it, and then conclude they’re on their way to delivering commercial supersonic passenger planes in five yearsBoom Aero is one of those companies I want to see succeed, but everything I read about them tickles my vaporware senses. Snowing off a one-off prototype that doesn’t resemble the final product in any way (other than speed) is a classic sign of a company spending money to appeal to investors.Retiring the plane after only a few flights is also a puzzling move. Wouldn’t they be making changes and collecting data as much as possible on their one prototype?",

After an announced delay on the ground, I wedged myself between a cargo pallet and the wall, threw a ratchet strap across as a \"belt\" and passed out on a metal floor with a backpack for a pillow.  No in-flight meals.  No safety briefs.  No entertainment systems.  No drink service.  Nothing.  I don't even remember the takeoff.  The only thing anyone said to me was \"Uh, sir... We are about to land. You have to get up.\"  THAT is what I want from flying.  Give me a bit of peace, a chance to sleep, and I couldn't care less how fast or slow the journey.",

It makes sense to test that kind of thing with the smallest possible model first, then see if you can scale it up to passenger size without losing that quiet acceleration.  Their timeline for doing that may be optimistic, but what they're doing makes sense.",

I don't know if Boom is explicitly doing rapid spiral development, but this is what it would look like from the outside - a development vehicle that doesn't resemble the final vehicle design in many ways, but does have strategically selected commonality to validate and buy down risk on specific subsystems and operational concepts. They may be retiring XB-1 simply because they got the data they needed.That being said, I share your skepticism of Boom as a company. As far as I know, they still don't have an engine for their production aircraft design.",

So much time is wasted with security, boarding, taxi-ing, waiting at the destination for a gate to unload, etc. that the flight speed is not a big deal. Existing commercial passenger jets could already go faster without going supersonic and save some time, but it doesn't matter. Even if you fly commercial passenger jets at the absolutely face-melting Mach 3.3 of the SR-71, you don't really save enough time to matter. The maximum speed in flight doesn't do anything to address ground delays.",
