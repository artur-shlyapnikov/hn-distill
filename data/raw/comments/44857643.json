    "textPlain": "> XB-1 is the world’s first independently-developed supersonic jet, breaking the sound barrier for the first time in January, 2025. It was designed, built, and flown successfully by a team of just 50 peopleThis is a great headline and very impressive. However, it’s also somewhat puzzling to see the company spend so much investment money to build a small prototype plane that doesn’t resemble a commercial airliner in any way, break the sound barrier 6 times, retire it, and then conclude they’re on their way to delivering commercial supersonic passenger planes in five yearsBoom Aero is one of those companies I want to see succeed, but everything I read about them tickles my vaporware senses. Snowing off a one-off prototype that doesn’t resemble the final product in any way (other than speed) is a classic sign of a company spending money to appeal to investors.Retiring the plane after only a few flights is also a puzzling move. Wouldn’t they be making changes and collecting data as much as possible on their one prototype?",

    "textPlain": "My take is that they felt like they were already pushing their luck with the prototype and didn't want to scare investors away when it inevitably crashed.I share your skepticism, especially with their timeline.  It has been some time since I looked at them closely, but they originally pitched developing their own supersonic capable turbofan to power their eventual production model.  Especially with such a small team that seemed overly ambitious to me.",

    "textPlain": "I work in aerospace and I don't find this development strategy unusual prima facie. I don't know if Boom is explicitly doing rapid spiral development, but this is what it would look like from the outside - a development vehicle that doesn't resemble the final vehicle design in many ways, but does have strategically selected commonality to validate and buy down risk on specific subsystems and operational concepts. They may be retiring XB-1 simply because they got the data they needed.That being said, I share your skepticism of Boom as a company. As far as I know, they still don't have an engine for their production aircraft design.",
