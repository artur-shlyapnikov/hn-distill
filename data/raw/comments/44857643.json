    "textPlain": "> Together with a few other optimizations, these tweaks yielded over 1,000mi in increased range—enough that we could now afford a remarkable passenger cabin without sacrificing fuel efficiency or range.Honestly, the way the narrative reads, they're still sacrificing 1,000mi of range in the interests of an improved cabin experience.  They've just  found an optimisation that enables them to reach a net neutral state.Given we're effectively talking about fuel efficiency here, it's hard to imagine airlines wanting an improved cabin vs less fuel consumption.  All the incentives are on them already to meet a \"barest minimum\" cabin experience that they can get away with, because every bit of luxury costs them in numbers of passengers, and fuel costs.",

It was designed, built, and flown successfully by a team of just 50 peopleThis is a great headline and very impressive. However, it’s also somewhat puzzling to see the company spend so much investment money to build a small prototype plane that doesn’t resemble a commercial airliner in any way, break the sound barrier 6 times, retire it, and then conclude they’re on their way to delivering commercial supersonic passenger planes in five yearsBoom Aero is one of those companies I want to see succeed, but everything I read about them tickles my vaporware senses. Snowing off a one-off prototype that doesn’t resemble the final product in any way (other than speed) is a classic sign of a company spending money to appeal to investors.Retiring the plane after only a few flights is also a puzzling move. Wouldn’t they be making changes and collecting data as much as possible on their one prototype?",

You think either would risk hundreds of millions and years of development without talking to each other?

Initially created in a simpler form for XB-1, mkBoom has evolved significantly and is now pivotal to designing our Overture airliner.\"This is the same overture airframe that supposedly had it's final design released in July of 2022? And was supposed to be rolled out in 2025? And have it's first commercial passengers in 2029? (Ref. 1)But apparently 18 months ago the structure was being redesigned in such a way that caused a 1000 mile range loss (that is described as \"subtle\" fuselage change)? And in response to that last year they completely redesigned the engines and regained that 1000 miles of lost range... Sure.More importantly, given the FAA states they a new aircraft takes 5-9 years to certify (Ref 2.) it seems the 2029 target is not viable any longer right?
