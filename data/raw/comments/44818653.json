    "textPlain": "\"Life is, of course, just like this: You get only one shot, and it’s up to you to make the most of it by rejecting okay or even pretty good ways to allocate your time or other resources\"Simple counter example: a boxing champion gets the title once, but defends it for years. If he gets the title once and gives up, he will not be remembered because he left no legacy.\"I think quitting is one of my primary superpowers. Success in multiple fields is only possible if you’re willing to quit multiple fields\"Also I disagree. To stick with the boxer example: many boxers come back to fight after retirement, at an age where they can't fight and their body accumulated lots of damage. But why do they come back then ? Because after spending a good part of their life to reach that shot, they realize they don't have time to develop other skills to thrive in life, they can't have multiple successes. That's why they come back to do what it took them time to learn: fighting.\nIt takes time to seriously succeed at anything, even when you are talented you need time and practice.I disagree with most  other statements.",
