And I share in their concern about the meta-game here: the consolidation of capital, land, and power over the food supply.Consumers already have a hard time having any lever against rising grocery costs. Consolidation earlier on in the supply chain is not helping.Which is to say, automation in this space isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but it can enable strange market dynamics (/imbalanced power dynamics) over food, which is objectively a bad thing.",
