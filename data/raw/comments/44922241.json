    "textPlain": "I wish Microsoft reverted to its 1990s style of making tools for power users that don’t get in the way.  Windows 2000 was peak Windows to me.  Security issues aside, it was a solid OS.  It also had a non-flashy interface that got out of my way.  No annoying notifications, no distractions: just pure Windows.  Windows 2000 respected the user.Today’s versions of Windows seem less respectful of the user.  Microsoft is treating Windows as a platform to advertise Microsoft’s products rather than as strictly a productivity tool.  Even if a lot of users these days use computers more like entertainment and communication devices rather than productivity tools, software should still get out of the user’s way.  Software should shut up and do what the user commands.Unfortunately there are other software systems that have the same philosophy.  Google constantly nags me regarding logging in and switching to Chrome.  Even macOS has gotten a lot more nag screens in the past decade compared to the glory years of Jobs-era Mac OS X.It’s amazing how so many organizations are dependent on Windows, macOS, and Google for their productivity, yet these platforms have become more annoying to use over the years, becoming impediments to productivity.",

The only problem is on Linux if you have focus let's say in desktop 1 monitor 2 (tmux in alactity), you them do win+2 to go to screen 2 into a browser(still monitor 2), you then press win+2 hoping to go back to desktop 1 alacritty...
