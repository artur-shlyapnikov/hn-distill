    "textPlain": "I wish Microsoft reverted to its 1990s style of making tools for power users that don’t get in the way.  Windows 2000 was peak Windows to me.  Security issues aside, it was a solid OS.  It also had a non-flashy interface that got out of my way.  No annoying notifications, no distractions: just pure Windows.  Windows 2000 respected the user.Today’s versions of Windows seem less respectful of the user.  Microsoft is treating Windows as a platform to advertise Microsoft’s products rather than as strictly a productivity tool.  Even if a lot of users these days use computers more like entertainment and communication devices rather than productivity tools, software should still get out of the user’s way.  Software should shut up and do what the user commands.Unfortunately there are other software systems that have the same philosophy.  Google constantly nags me regarding logging in and switching to Chrome.  Even macOS has gotten a lot more nag screens in the past decade compared to the glory years of Jobs-era Mac OS X.It’s amazing how so many organizations are dependent on Windows, macOS, and Google for their productivity, yet these platforms have become more annoying to use over the years, becoming impediments to productivity.",

Think about the ribbons of tools available in Office -- Excel and Word in particular have features for pretty much anything you can think of. I'm not arguing it's not a valid choice -- I'm sure someone needs all those features. But for me, personally, I prefer products that do a smaller set of things simply and perfectly, as opposed to products that do All The Things somewhat well. Even if it does everything very well, having all those extra features in the way makes it harder to get the few things I want to do harder.",

Now we're in a stupid era of the browser is the UI and everything is non-conformant with everything else in terms of looks/expectation/behaviour.The version of MS-Office prior to the stupid ribbon-shit were also the peak versions. It's all been downhill since then with Windows ME and Windows 8 being exceptionally low points.I'm about to shift to FreeBSD as my main driver as the Linux distribution fragmentation and wane in reliability/dependability and repeatability has given me the shits (how many apt-get equivalents are there now...?) I used to like Debian back in the day but now it and its derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu) give me the shits and Red-Hat and Fedora likewise, and Debian itself won't even install a working desktop. Apparently raising a bug for Fedora gets put into \"Closed - not a bug\" because IBM don't give a shit about quality anymore - even though the install resulted in an unbootable OS and I spent hours raising a proper bug report. Pop-OS was reasonable, but scaling where some apps have both big and little font sizes intermixed still mean its a clusterfuck of a kludge.It's 2025 and apparently trying to mount network shares in fstab before the network interface is up isn't a bug. It's still not year of the desktop for Linux.FWIW, I liked Apple in the 1980's - not so much since then.I still appreciate all the contributions of those individuals out there is both GNU/Linux and the BSD'd trying to make the world a better place for themselves/others and sharing the results.",

These days Microsoft is openly and aggressively hostile to the user and its getting worse every update. This is yet another of the curses of monopoly, the monopolists will eventually hold those under its sway with utter contempt. They are going to do things their way, and you are going to take it.",

(Off-topic) This should explain why layoffs are so acceptable, even in the face of record profits.There’s a reason why their stock price is through the roof. Companies in the US have their first and foremost duty towards Shareholders, and only shareholders. This is not an opinion, I am speaking legally.[1] And what the shareholders want is for the company to squeeze out every dollar it possibly can from its products.[1] Shareholder Primacy: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.",

If I didn't have a mobile handy as backup (which I didn't, until recently) I'd basically be looking at a bricked PC.This is about as dark-pattern-ey as it gets.

A message flew by too quickly to see much less read, then totally black and unresponsive.At that point I had a choice.  I could buy a new version of Windows 11 for $200 which is much worse than the Windows 7 I gave up.  Or I could switch to Linux.  Hello Linux!
