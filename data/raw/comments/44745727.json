That makes it nicer from a softer dev perspective but IMO less nice from a mathematical perspective.",

It seems not, I gather the proof will rely on classical not constructive logic.\"3. Proof by Contradiction:\nThe core of the formal proof involves assuming ¬Fermat_Last_Theorem and deriving a contradiction. This contradiction usually arises from building a mathematical structure (like an elliptic curve) based on the assumed solution and then demonstrating that this structure must possess contradictory properties, violating established theorems. \n4. Formalizing Contradiction:\nThe contradiction is formalized in Lean by deriving two conflicting statements, often denoted as Q and ¬Q, within the context of the assumed ¬Fermat_Last_Theorem. Since Lean adheres to classical logic, the existence of these conflicting statements implies that the initial assumption (¬Fermat_Last_Theorem) must be false.\"(gemini llm answer to google query: Lean formalization of fermat's last theorem \"proof by contradiction\")",
