    "textPlain": "I developed a telephony agent service to help my aging parents, who aren't fluent in English, navigate their healthcare needs. My parents simply talk to the agent, which I call Maya, in their native language. Maya then understands their requests and handles the outgoing calls to various offices and providers in English.\nSo far, it's been an invaluable resource for them, helping with three key tasks:\nScheduling doctor's appointments across multiple insurance plans.\nChecking pharmacy readiness for medicine pickups.\nArranging transportation (both medical and non-medical) through services like CalOptima and OC ACCESS.\nThe system uses a straightforward tech stack on AWS, combining separate ASR, LLM, and TTS models. It's a pragmatic solution I built because I couldn't find an existing service that fit my specific requirements.\nIt’s been so useful for my family that I'm starting to wonder if this could help others in similar situations.\nWhat do you think, Hacker News? Is there a broader need for a service like this? I'm looking for your honest and brutal feedback on whether I should pursue this full-time.Note: due to lack of scaling resources, only messaging works for general public. if you would like to test voice, I am happy to add you to whitelisted phone numbers.",

    "textPlain": "> Is there a broader need for a service like this?This is a good question to ask of people who are like your aging parents (asking here in HN may not be very useful if your potential customers are not HN readers).  If you talk to enough people you'll get a sense of who really wants it.",

    "textPlain": "It's not a new idea, seeing as Google pretty much announced this years ago. I don't know how much uptake it got (it isn't available in my country) but it's definitely one of the main real-world use cases of LLMs and related AI that I can see surviving the bubble. If you can get enough money out of it to pay for your service costs, that seems like an excellent tool.That said, my experience with LLMs is that they tend to lie/misrepresent user input and intention, especially when translating text. Doesn't sound like a problem to me if you're just ordering pizza or scheduling a haircut, but when it comes to healthcare, that might become problematic. Furthermore, there are quite a few regulations when it comes to healthcare services that you might need to double check, just to make sure you're avoiding having to comply with difficult and expensive regulation. Not really an issue for a tool built for your parents, but when you're marketing it to people (especially vulnerable groups, like people not speaking the language of the country they're in).Also, does this bot announce that it's a bot?Also, how will you prevent scam callcenters from ruining your bot's reputation? Is there some kind of abuse detection in place? Because if you just have a service that will call people and tell them what you instruct it to tell them, I can guarantee that malicious people will flock to it.",

This is a fantastic use of AI, and you've already done the leg work making it functional and building a concise \"what is it\" site that is very clear.There are many non native speakers in many countries, this could very quickly become a great global service. Be careful with privacy and hosted data, especially medical.Well done to you!",
