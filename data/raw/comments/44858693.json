    "textPlain": "I developed a telephony agent service to help my aging parents, who aren't fluent in English, navigate their healthcare needs. My parents simply talk to the agent, which I call Maya, in their native language. Maya then understands their requests and handles the outgoing calls to various offices and providers in English.\nSo far, it's been an invaluable resource for them, helping with three key tasks:\nScheduling doctor's appointments across multiple insurance plans.\nChecking pharmacy readiness for medicine pickups.\nArranging transportation (both medical and non-medical) through services like CalOptima and OC ACCESS.\nThe system uses a straightforward tech stack on AWS, combining separate ASR, LLM, and TTS models. It's a pragmatic solution I built because I couldn't find an existing service that fit my specific requirements.\nIt’s been so useful for my family that I'm starting to wonder if this could help others in similar situations.\nWhat do you think, Hacker News? Is there a broader need for a service like this? I'm looking for your honest and brutal feedback on whether I should pursue this full-time.Note: due to lack of scaling resources, only messaging works for general public. if you would like to test voice, I am happy to add you to whitelisted phone numbers.",
