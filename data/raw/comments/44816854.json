    "textPlain": "If you have an awesome product and 9 months of runway left and you admit that you could better marketing, why don't you focus 100% on the business for now and try to grow the revenue by doing better marketing ? Also try and stretch that runway for more like 12-18 months if possible. Go all in. What is stopping you ?The thing is that if you are planning for Plan B and get a job, it sounds like you have already given up and will just burn Investor money for next 9 months while planning to get back in the job market.",

Reach out to folks you previously worked with in past companies, especially those in tech leadership positions. With more and more AI applicants trust is weighed more than ever and existing relationships is a major leverage point now.I don't know if this \"should\" be how it is but this is the reality based on what I observe now. Hopefully you have some relationships you can reach out to.",

Focus on the managerial route for a period of X months. Forget about positioning yourself for an IC role, since it's not your preference.*2. Treat this as a GTM project. You are the product.I'm willing to bet that - based on your experience - you'd have a hell of a narrative that differentiates you.*If an IC role is offered to you while you're looking for a managerial role - seriously consider taking it - to hedge.",

    "textPlain": "My only advice is when you get there, take what you can get for now and passively look until you can find a better fit.  There's still a fair amount of contract work, a lot of it isn't the same level of pay from even a year or two ago though.I spent the better part of the past couple years not working, and finally had to break down and take what I could get instead of holding out... I wish I'd done it months sooner, before hitting that critical point.",
