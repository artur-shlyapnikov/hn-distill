    "textPlain": "This is interesting because there can be a fine line between camaraderie and insularism.  A feel-good atmosphere among workers is good, but if it doesn't include everyone, it can lead to favoritism towards those in the group relative to those outside, and that's not good.  This can be especially important when people who aren't part of the org at all come into the equation (e.g., leading to the classic experience where a customer gets the feeling they're being a bother by expecting employees to help them rather than continue their private banter).I think it's healthy to have these off-topic spaces, but also important to make sure that everyone in the org has some such space that meets their needs, and that everyone understands where the line is for when you have to put the fun aside and do what needs to be done.",

Funny how it’s such an alien concept the moment work moves online.Offline people were in the same building under direct watch from the employer. We badged to enter and leave the building, employers surely felt fully in control.Online that physical boundary disappearing, the pendulum swings the other way for companies that try to grasp the remaining bits of control.That's one of the reason I prefer fully online shops, they'll usually have made peace with it and structured themselves in saner ways.",

Apart from this, I don’t know how the chats will be used, who else might have some kind of access to those (IT, HR), etc. The pervasive monitoring of all network traffic makes it all seem like always being under the view of a panopticon.I love working remote and don’t really want to go to the office (a tiring commute is one of the reasons; not having as much flexibility is another).

    "textPlain": "> You can create as many Slack channels as you want, but all that is worthless if you don’t build the culture where it’s okay to use them.Well the problem with corporate offtopic spaces is obvious: It is (potential) surveillance. One of the essential properties of the coffee kitchen at the office is that only you and the person who was there know what you said.People at work will occasionally like to talk about things their collegues or bosses don't need to hear. That doesn't even mean it needs to be badmouthing others. Let's say you're really into model trains, it is easier saying that in person to the one other guy who acts a bit nerdy, than to announce it online in front of potentially everybody.I leave it to you how you think this could be fixed.",
