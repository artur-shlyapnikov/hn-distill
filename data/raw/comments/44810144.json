It always catches me by surprise that you can get \"a cold\" in summer.Oh, well, I don't really mind, it is one of the few times I rest and don't keep chipping away at my todo-list.It sucks too though, because I also had plans with friends and it's harder to make new plans since many of my friends are teachers and start working soon, around the 20th.",
