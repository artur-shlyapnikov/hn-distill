    "textPlain": "Apple’s announcement should be welcomed as a tangible demonstration of corporate accountability in the age of offshore tax minimisation and digital opacity. Rather than simply repurchasing stock or warehousing profits abroad, Apple is deploying capital to grow its US footprint, support domestic suppliers and invest in technological infrastructure.The program’s breadth also deserves recognition. It includes manufacturing partnerships, data centres, clean energy, and support for educational and community initiatives. This is not PR fluff. Apple’s prior commitments funded chipmaking in Arizona, new engineering hubs and 5G innovation. The expansion builds on that trajectory.Critics may argue Apple is acting in self-interest. So be it. Public policy should align incentives such that private benefit also serves the public good. In this case, job creation, supply chain resilience, and regional development in states like Iowa and Oregon are clear wins.Of course, Apple’s global tax practices remain a fair target. But criticising every constructive move on that basis alone risks undermining the very kind of behaviour governments should encourage: strategic reinvestment, not financial engineering.This is a large, measurable, and multi-year commitment. It should be acknowledged as such.",

Or is this in addition to those efforts as a plea for the current administration to drop India’s tariffs?Either way, India seems like it has once again miscalculated who to side with on the world stage. Russian oil may be cheap, but Russia hasn’t been a reliable ally to any country in the past 30 years, and now India looks set to lose significant investments from the US.",
