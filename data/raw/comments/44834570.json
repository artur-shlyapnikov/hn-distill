    "textPlain": "The whites are an amazing resource for mountain sports of all levels. They are a bit deceptive as they lack the craggy above tree line terrain, or altitude of younger ranges - but they provide some of the longest and toughest trails in the world due to steep rocky trails which lack switchbacks. The mountains are mostly down to hard granite at this point, and as such don’t have the nice smooth trails of younger mountains.",

Four very different seasons, lots of weather.Basically anything you want to find in mountains, you can find in the Whites. Ice climbing, mountaineering, multi-pitch trad climbing, bushwhacking, easy trails, empty trails, whatever. I was very lucky to be able to hike there.",

This is my backyard.\"I grew up smack in the middle of the White Mountains with a clear view of the presidential peaks. I have to say, at no point did I think, \"Huh, I really should climb all those.\"That said, for pre-season high school cross country training one year, we jogged up to the visitor center at the top of Mt. Washington. Not many people can say they did that. I also had friends who had summer jobs hauling building supplies and tools up and down the Appalachian trails to maintain the trails and huts. They were in insane shape when school started from carrying bags of concrete mix or a stack of bricks up and back every day.",

At one point below the treeline as we are crawling down, these two guys catch up to us; they looked like they were in their 60s.  Grey hair, thin as twigs.  They whooshed past us literally hopping rock-to-rock.  That one little moment had a lifelong impact on me ever after as I though how nice it would be to be able to do the same at that kind of age.",
