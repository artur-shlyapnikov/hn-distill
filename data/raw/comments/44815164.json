Decentralized message relays have the potential to work anywhere, be fully private, extremely difficult to block/censor, and (in theory) can scale indefinitely.[0]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireChat[1]: https://briarproject.org/",

Unfortunate to see progress is about the same.Going to Burning Man for the first time this year. Some of my campmates are keen on giving mesh networking another shot through https://www.burningmesh.org/. Will be interesting to see if using dedicated hardware, rather than just software on phones, makes connectivity & communication more reliable.",

I’m doubtful Bitchat will ever be used outside of a group of nerds at a festival.We need a standardised protocol commonly implemented by manufacturers. The closest we have now that I’m aware of is Apple’s Find My network in which it is possible to smuggle arbitrary data very slowly. [0][0]: https://github.com/positive-security/send-my",

Maybe newer BLE revisions improved this.",
