    "textPlain": "I think the claim about higher efficiency is due to the fact that the sea temp is stable and they don’t have to deal with algae blooms at the bottom of the ocean.I don’t see how taking advantage of the pressure at lower depths makes much sense. The water would still need to be pumped to the surface, which I think would take as much energy as just pressurizing it.Did I miss something?",

    "textPlain": "One thing I'd be curious to know about is the efficiency of pumping from 500 meters deep. That's a real issue.Pumping up becomes really inefficient. Large buildings, for example, get around this by pumping to intermediate tanks [1].This isn't really an option underwater so I'm curious how they'd handle it. Depending on how much more expensive that is to build and how much energy it consumes, this may just not be economical.[1]: https://www.sloan.com/sites/default/files/2016-06/burj-khali...",
