    "textPlain": "It's interesting that measuring speech vibration is possible, but on the whole I don't see this as viable attack. One  would need to get real close to a target, the cited 60% accuracy is at 50 cm distance. At 300 cm they report 2% which seems on the level of guessing words randomly.The \"remotely\" in the title is no warranted in my view. Of course there may be ways to improve on their results. But so far it seems to me that a highly directional microphone would outperform the radar at any distance. One interesting aspect here is how sensitive the attack is to ambient noise. So maybe sitting close to a target with a radar hidden in headphones, one could glean some words even in a noisy environment like a subway. But I'd still put my money on a microphone performing better in that environment.Now I wonder whether the attack would work better on headphones. They are smaller and should vibrate more. On the other hand the surface is smaller, so on the whole they might not provide more signal to a radar.",
