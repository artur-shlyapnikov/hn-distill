    "textPlain": "64bitÂ RISC5 is cheap & has significant advantages around address space, computational efficiency, and suitability for high-performance applications while being more future-proof for complex systems.It is cheap also, with the F133*, priced at approximately $1.00 to $1.50 per unit in bulkIf looking more for US stuff (fabbed in South Korea), PIC64GX1000 can be as little as $21 but much more capable.",
