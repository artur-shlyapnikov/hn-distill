Fun site to be on.My issue is that crawlers aren’t respecting robots.txt, they are capable of operating captchas, human verification check boxes, and can extract all your content and information as a tree in a matter of minutes.Throttling doesn’t help when you have to load a bunch of assets with your page. IP range blocking doesn’t work because they’re lambdas essentially. Their user-agent info looks like someone on Chrome trying to browse your site.We can’t even render everything to a canvas to stop it.The only remaining tactic is verification through authorization.

Are they making our lives better? Not really. They mostly threaten a bunch of people's jobs (who may find some other means to make a living but it's not looking very good).It's not like AI has opened up some \"new opportunity\" for humans. It has opened up \"new opportunity\" for very large and wealthy companies to become even larger and wealthier.

They criticise generative AI for repackaging other people’s hard work into bland, soulless output, unlike trusted recipe writers whose work is tested, personal, and distinctive.Has this guy ever googled a recipe and clicked on a result?
