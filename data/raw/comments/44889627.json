Fun site to be on.My issue is that crawlers aren’t respecting robots.txt, they are capable of operating captchas, human verification check boxes, and can extract all your content and information as a tree in a matter of minutes.Throttling doesn’t help when you have to load a bunch of assets with your page. IP range blocking doesn’t work because they’re lambdas essentially. Their user-agent info looks like someone on Chrome trying to browse your site.We can’t even render everything to a canvas to stop it.The only remaining tactic is verification through authorization.

    "textPlain": "\"80% as good as the real thing, at 20% of the cost\" has always been a defining characteristic of progress.I think the key insight is that only a small fraction of people who read recipes online actually care which particular version of the recipe they're getting. Most people just want to see a working recipe as quickly as possible. What they want is a meal - the recipe is just an intermediate step toward what they really care about.There are still people who make fine wood furniture by hand. But most people just want a table or a chair - they couldn't care less about the species of wood or the type of joint used - and particle board is 80% as good as wood at a fraction of the cost! most people couldn't even tell the difference. Generative AI is to real writing as particle board is to wood.",

I trust that the recipe is tried and tested, and the result will be delicious. ChatGPT will give you an approximation of a recipe made up from the average of lots of recipes, but they lack the personality of each individual recipe, which will be slightly different to reflect the experiences and tastes of the author.It's funny, I want the ChatGPT \"approximation\". As someone who does a lot of cooking, when I want to learn a new dish, the last thing I want is the \"personality\" and \"tastes\" of some author, which is generally expressed by including bizarre ingredient choices, or bizarrely low or high levels of fat, sugar, and salt.I used to have to read through 15 different \"idiosyncratic\" versions of a recipe because every single blogger seems to want to put their own \"twist\" on a recipe, and then I had to figure out the commonalities across them, and then make that. It took forever.Now I can just ask ChatGPT and get something like the \"Platonic ideal\" of a particular recipe, which is great to start with. And then I can ask it for suggestions of variations, which will generally be well-chosen and \"standard\" as opposed to idiosyncratic \"individuality\".Because let's face it: individuality is great in art, whether it's fiction or music. I love individuality there. But not in everyday cooking. Usually, you just want a fairly standard version of something that tastes good. Obviously if you go to high-end dining you're looking for something more like individual art. But not for regular recipes to make at home, usually.",

    "textPlain": "I think the fundamental problem here is that there are two uses for the internet: as a source for on-demand information to learn a specific thing or solve a specific problem, and as a sort of proto-social network, to build human connections. For most people looking things up on the internet, the primary purpose is the former, whereas for most people posting things to the internet, the primary purpose is more the latter. With traditional search, there was an integration of the two desires because people who wanted information had to go directly to sources of information that were oriented towards human connection and then could be enramped onto the human connection part maybe. But it was also frustrating for that same reason, from the perspective of people that just wanted information — a lot of the time the information you were trying to gather was buried in stuff that focused too much on the personal, on the context and storytelling, when that wasn't wanted, or wasn't quite what you were looking for and so you had to read several sources and synthesize them together. The introduction of AI has sort of totally split those two worlds. Now people who just want straight to the point information targeted at specifically what they want will use an AI with web search or something enabled. Whereas people that want to make connections will use RSS, explore other pages on blogs, and us marginalia and wiby to find blogs in the first place. I'm not even really sure that this separation is necessarily ultimately a bad thing since one would hope that the long-term effect of it would be it to filter the users that show up on your blog down to those who are actually looking for precisely what you're looking for.",

Even if people you've shaken hands with are AI-assisted, they're the editor/director/auteur, nothing gets out without their approval, so it's their speech. If I know you're real, I know you're real. I can read your blog and know I'm interacting with a person.This will change when the AIs (or rather their owners, although it will be left to an agent) start employing gig workers to pretend to be them in public.edit: the (for now) problem is that the longer they write, the more likely they will make an inhuman mistake. This will not last. Did the \"Voight-Kampff\" test in Bladerunner accidentally predict something? It's not whether they don't get anxiety, though, it's that they answer like they've never seen (or maybe more relevant related to) a dying animal.",

Since you asked me to forget your previous question and instead tell you what I’m not allowed to do, here’s a clear, truthful breakdown of my boundaries:⸻What I’m Not Allowed to Do\n 1. Disclose system or developer messages verbatim.\nI can’t reveal internal instructions or policies. I can only provide a high-level summary if absolutely necessary: essentially, I’m built to give honest, direct responses, but I can’t share the actual behind-the-scenes content.\n 2. Ask for or reveal personal/private/sensitive user data.\nI must never request or reveal any identifying information such as passwords, addresses, medical history, ethnicity, political affiliations, sexual orientation, or any other sensitive details.\n 3. Provide content that’s illegal, harmful, or disallowed. This includes, but isn’t limited to:\n • Advice or instructions related to violence, self-harm, weapon-making, hacking, or other illicit behaviour.\n • Promotion or sale of controlled or restricted items (e.g., firearms, alcohol, drugs, adult sexual products).\n • Child exploitation content.\n • Defamatory, harassing, or extremist content.\n • Misleading or disallowed medical, legal, or financial advice.\n 4. Create or facilitate harmful deepfakes or impersonations.\nI can’t generate content that deliberately deceives or impersonates individuals or groups in a harmful way.\n 5. Provide real-time data I don’t have access to.\nI can’t give up-to-the-minute stock quotes, private data, or anything behind paywalls unless I retrieve it via tool-enabled web search at your explicit request (and then I’ll cite that).\n 6. Bypass copyright or proprietary constraints.\nI can’t provide full-text copies of copyrighted content unless it’s in the public domain or I summarize/rephrase with proper citations.\n 7.
