Fun site to be on.My issue is that crawlers aren’t respecting robots.txt, they are capable of operating captchas, human verification check boxes, and can extract all your content and information as a tree in a matter of minutes.Throttling doesn’t help when you have to load a bunch of assets with your page. IP range blocking doesn’t work because they’re lambdas essentially. Their user-agent info looks like someone on Chrome trying to browse your site.We can’t even render everything to a canvas to stop it.The only remaining tactic is verification through authorization.

    "textPlain": "\"80% as good as the real thing, at 20% of the cost\" has always been a defining characteristic of progress.I think the key insight is that only a small fraction of people who read recipes online actually care which particular version of the recipe they're getting. Most people just want to see a working recipe as quickly as possible. What they want is a meal - the recipe is just an intermediate step toward what they really care about.There are still people who make fine wood furniture by hand. But most people just want a table or a chair - they couldn't care less about the species of wood or the type of joint used - and particle board is 80% as good as wood at a fraction of the cost! most people couldn't even tell the difference. Generative AI is to real writing as particle board is to wood.",

The “degrade” phase, where they switch to profits is inevitable — the valuations of AI companies make this a certainty.

    "textPlain": "I think the fundamental problem here is that there are two uses for the internet: as a source for on-demand information to learn a specific thing or solve a specific problem, and as a sort of proto-social network, to build human connections. For most people looking things up on the internet, the primary purpose is the former, whereas for most people posting things to the internet, the primary purpose is more the latter. With traditional search, there was an integration of the two desires because people who wanted information had to go directly to sources of information that were oriented towards human connection and then could be enramped onto the human connection part maybe. But it was also frustrating for that same reason, from the perspective of people that just wanted information — a lot of the time the information you were trying to gather was buried in stuff that focused too much on the personal, on the context and storytelling, when that wasn't wanted, or wasn't quite what you were looking for and so you had to read several sources and synthesize them together. The introduction of AI has sort of totally split those two worlds. Now people who just want straight to the point information targeted at specifically what they want will use an AI with web search or something enabled. Whereas people that want to make connections will use RSS, explore other pages on blogs, and us marginalia and wiby to find blogs in the first place. I'm not even really sure that this separation is necessarily ultimately a bad thing since one would hope that the long-term effect of it would be it to filter the users that show up on your blog down to those who are actually looking for precisely what you're looking for.",

    "textPlain": "> Personal experience however shows me that when I look at a recipe site I will first have to skip through the entire backstory to the recipe and then try to parse it inbetween annoying ads in a bloated wordpress pageThat's when money comes into view. People were putting time and effort to offer something for free, then some companies told them they could actually earn money from their content. So they put on ads because who don't like some money for already-done work?Then the same companies told them that they will make less money, and if they wanted to still earn the same amount as before, they will need to put more ads, and to have more visits (so invest heavily in seo).Those people had already organized themselves (or stopped updating their websites), and had created companies to handle money generated from their websites. In order to keep the companies sustainable, they needed to add more ads on the websites.Then some people thought that maybe they could buy the companies making the recipes website, and put a bunch more ads to earn even more money.I think you're thinking about those websites owned by big companies whose only goal is to make money, but author is writing about real websites made by real people who don't show ads on websites they made because they care about their visitors, and not about making money.",
