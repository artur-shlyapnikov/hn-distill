I expect it's also a radical oversimplification to suggest that Craigslist alone decimated newspapers.",

It started out as an online list for his circle of friends.- The main competitor then was \"Classifieds\" section in newspapers. Craigslist out-competed them by simply being a better medium (No word-count limit + photo support).- Meanwhile, newspaper executives failed to respond in a meaning manner. By 2010, 70% of their classified ad business was gone.Craig seems to be fully retired by now, focusing on his philanthropy work, which I think is awesome.",
