    "textPlain": "It'sÂ the Javelin Anti cheat system which forces the use of secure boot.This conversation already covers a lot of the anticheat linux issue:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21947047It's been about a year since MS managed to release an update that hit dual boot users running linux with secure boot. They released a fix in may this year, so hopefully going forward that won't be an issue.However if you're running \"old\" hardware you've still got the expiring keys issue with secure boot to deal with.https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/linux-users-are-about...I think there's a bit of a confluence between ai making graphics cards more widely useful for work machines, the hostile malware like nature of anti cheat,  and the worrying unreliability of secure boot, that coupled with the higher cost of graphics card (making it less affordable to just have a second machine) that make this problem more untenable.Really does give more credence to the \"doomsayers\" of yester year who denounced secure boot.Will be interesting to see how it all plays out with MS proclaiming they're going to fence off ring 0 access after crowdstrike, and the growing popularity of linux as a gaming platform (as a realist, i'm betting on depressing. It'll play out depreesingly).",
