If I ask a question in one chat, then switch to another chat and ask a question, it will block until the first one is done.Also Tauri apps feel pretty clunky on Linux for me.",

It also tries to allocate 30gb that is the size of the model but my vram is only 10gb and machine is 32gb, so it does not make sense. Ollama works perfect with 30b models.\nAnother thing that is not good is that it make constant connections to github and other sites.",
