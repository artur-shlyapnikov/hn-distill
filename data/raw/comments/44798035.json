    "textPlain": "I would see Proxmox come up in so many homelab type conversations so I tried 8.* on a mini pc. The impression I got was that the project probably provides the most value in a clustered environment or even on a single node if someone prefers using a web UI. What didn't seem very clear was an out-of-box way for declaring VM and container configurations [1] that could then be version controlled. Common approaches seemed to involve writing scripts or reach for other tools like Ansible. Whereas something like LXD/Incus makes this easier [2] by default. Or maybe I'm missing some details?[1] https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/default-settings-of-contai...[2] https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/instances_...",

The last time I tried, there wasn't a way to use shared storage (i.e., iscsi block devices) across multiple nodes and have a failover of VMs that use that storage. And by failover I mean moving a VM to another host and booting it there, not even keeping the VM running.",

We evaluated many things, they were either to light or to heavy for our users and/or our group of hobbyist admins. A while back we also set up a backup server. Forum is also a great resource. I just failed to contribute a pull request via their git email workflow and I am now stuck with a non-upstreamed patch to the LDAP Sync (btw. the code there is IMHO not the best part of PVE). In general, while the system works great as a monolith, extending it is IMHO really not easily possible. We have some cludges all over the place (mostly using the really good API), that could be better integrated, e.g. with the UI. At least I did not find a way to e.g. add a new auth provider easily.",

I've had to restore more than handful of VMs for various reasons, and they've all been rock-solid upon restoration. I would like to use its high-availability features, but haven't needed them and don't really have the time to tinker so much these days.",

We definitively need to clean a few documentation and resource things up, but we tried to make it so that it can be reused by others without tying them to our API types or the like.FWIW, the in-development Proxmox Datacenter Manager also uses our Rust / Yew based UI, it's basically our first 100% rust project (well, minus the Linux / Debian foundation naturally, but it's getting there ;-)",
