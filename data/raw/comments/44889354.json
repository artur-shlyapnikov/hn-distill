So...  * Patch 1: https://www.bi6.us/ER/MSH/0001-add-closing-paren-to-org-social-parse-feed-to-comple.patch  \n  * Patch 2: https://www.bi6.us/ER/MSH/0002-Add-my-social-URL-to-the-registers.txt-file.patch\n\nWell, yes, technically you only need the first patch to get it to work.  The second patch adds my name to the list of social-org sites.  They're both one line changes, so it should be easy to verify I'm not adding to the global index of chicanery through software.And if it's been a while since you applied a patch to a repo (instead of just pulled from a repo you merged into), here's the HOWTO I wrote about it:  * https://www.bi6.us/GI/B/#/The%20Caveats/Applying%20Patches%20to%20Bare%20Repositories",

I made some modifications locally to my setup so that when browsing a .org file in eww, org-html-export-as-html would render it in the buffer as HTML directly. eww doesn't really support much styling via shr, so I was working on adding some basic css parsing to expand the range of expression for an org-based blog approach.Many people export their org file based blogs to HTML and then publish them, but my thought would be to skip that and instead provide a path for eww to directly render org files, cutting out my html export stopgap.",
