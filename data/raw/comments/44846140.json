    "textPlain": "On the one hand, that isn't necessarily a problem.  It can be just a useful algorithm for tool calling or whatever.On the other hand, if you're telling your investors that AGI is about two years away, then you can only do that for a few years.  Rumor has it that such claims were made?  Hopefully no big investors actually believed that.The real question to be asking is, based on current applications of LLMs, can one pay for the hardware to sustain it?  The comparison to smartphones is apt; by the time we got to the \"Samsung Galaxy\" phase, where only incremental improvements were coming, the industry was making a profit on each phone sold.  Are any of the big LLMs actually profitable yet?  And if they are, do they have any way to keep the DeepSeeks of the world from taking it away?What happens if you built your business on a service that turns out to be hugely expensive to run and not profitable?",

It took no time to find advisors who told me the whole program I had in mind could not gain ethics approval and was mathematically limited.  The former road block is now lifted due to the fact that nobody cares about ethics any more, the latter seems to be the remaining hurdle.",

In that case, what do the investors expect? Some sort of slave market of virtual people to exploit?",

Someone saying AGI is not coming can add as many arguments or opinions as they like but it does not usually invite to such a high scrutiny as saying they need to provide evidence.",
