So the market fills the void, and people get views and money for saying it.Don't use the fact that people are saying it, as evidence that it is true.",

This is not “critical” to remember.There are interesting and well thought out arguments for why the AGI is not coming with the current state of technology, dismissing those arguments as propaganda/clickbait is not warranted. Yannic is also an AI professional and expert, not one to be offhandedly dismissed because you don’t like the messaging.",
