    "textPlain": "The complete abandonment of budget models in the US is completely foreseeable from market dynamics and how the industry is structured.1. Economies of scale are the only way to build a budget car.2. The incremental costs of adding features are nearly zero. The vast majority of price comes from the basic costs of building a legal vehicle.3. Buyers generally won't reject a car for having features they don't care about, but they'll frequently reject a car for lacking a feature they deem important.4. Buyers have different preferences.In order to sell at a low price, automakers have to sell as many as possible to hit massive economies of scale. In order to sell that many, they need to please a huge number of buyers, which means they add a whole bunch of cheap features to satisfy as many buyers as they can without cannibalizing their higher-tier offerings.The other side of this is the price point that western OEMs can actually hit with economies of scale has climbed significantly in recently decades, in part due to inflation / wage pressures, but mainly due to massive institutional inefficiencies. Mary Barra's compensation alone adds several dollars to the price of each GM vehicle. Legally mandated dealer margins and fees add tens of percent to the price that consumers pay. The inefficiencies of spreading production for tax purposes across state and international borders adds more cost. So on and so forth, and the market feedback mechanisms to correct these issues are intentionally hampered by policy decisions to favor the current status quo.Change in the market needs support at the regulatory level.",

It's ok. Do the dumb thing and follow your desire.And you can hedge your bets. I have a manual transmission convertible sports car, sports sedan, and capacious station wagon all for less than the price of RAV4 Hybrid and between the three I always have at least one functional vehicle!",

If you use more, you pay more. You have incentive to buy a smaller, more basic car because they will ultimately cost you less.But not here. We gave exceptions on light trucks because that's all the big three could competently produce back when fuel economy standards were being introduced and we were getting our brains beaten in by the Japanese. Making more fuel-efficient vehicles requires R&D, and R&D spend is money not sent to a shareholder. Since the bigger vehicles don't count towards CAFE and smaller vehicles do, guess which vehicles the big three push harder to consumers?",

All the computers? All the design/coding? The costs for maintaining all of it? The cost of the extra complexity? No mention of any of that?Depends. The rearview camera thing? Probably not that expensive at this point; development costs have been amortized. Sensors probably are a bit more expensive.The thing that chaps my ass about it is that there's so little commonality among parts between models and makers. We're 40+ years into the microprocessor revolution and ECMs are still mostly bespoke designs that have closed code running on them. Why? One way to deal with the design/coding costs would be to simply spread it across more automotive manufacturers, because at the end of the day, most of them are trying to achieve the same goals with regards to the function of the component. It's like looking at the different lug nut patterns between automakers... there's only so many ways to mount a wheel on a hub and you could reduce the tooling cost to make those wheels if you shared it with someone else.> (Also don't get me started on the extra cost and complexity and loss of maintainability that emissions regulations have added to cars.
