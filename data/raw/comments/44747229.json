    "textPlain": "The prod-readiness concerns are fair, but mcp-use fills a real gap in the MCP stack: orchestration across many servers with far less boilerplate than the official SDK. Even if the agent is as another commenter fairly pointed out, just a LangChain wrapper, the six-line setup and server manager are a nice DX upgrade.What’s still missing is structured error semantics. Right now, when a tool explodes the LLM only sees a raw stack trace, so it can’t decide whether to retry or bail. Today, I saw another Show HN post on MCP here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44778968 which converts exceptions into a small JSON envelope (error, details, isRetryable, etc.) that agents can interpret. Dropping that into mcp-use’s client loop would give you observability + smarter retries for almost free.I might be missing some important nuances here between client side and server side MCP error handling, which I’ll leave to the authors to discuss. Just thought there might be a good open source collab opportunity here.",

    "textPlain": "Huge variety of problems with this for mid-market or enterprise use. This is basically a toy right now and can’t be used for solving repeatable, valuable problems for actual businesses, ie: stuff that matters.One: dependence on langchain.Two: Security? Observability?Three: You have never asked yourself, why would someone want to connect an LLM to infinite random mcp servers. The vast majority (of mcp tools and servers) are insecure, vibe coded, basically terrible.Four: There needs to be way more focus on quality versus quantity. It’s easy to connect LLMs to MCP servers, it’s not a problem companies are willing to spend much money on, the issue is ensuring LLMs call the right tools 98%+ of the time with the right parameters.Five: There are tons and tons of existing projects for connecting LLMs to 1000s of MCP servers, it’s not a novel project, has no technical moat, and importantly, doesn’t solve a super valuable problem.The better question to ask or problem to solve is this, given a high value problem, how do you get high values of accurate tool use, first time, while providing security and protection against side effects, jail breaking, random issues etc.Most companies using “mcp” have a model which is using one or two tools (max) at a time and struggling making it work consistently. Giving them a meta tool to connect to 1000s of (mostly useless) tools isn’t helpful and won’t be taken seriously.",

If you want to develop authorization with Dynamic Client Registration, it going to be another ~1000 lines. I think many developers will want to avoid that.
