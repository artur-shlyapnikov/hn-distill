This was seen as a problem: we don’t know how to pick a good utility function or even how to point an ai at a specific utility function, so any agent that was smarter than us was as likely as not to turn us all into paperclips, or carve smiles into our faces, or some other grim outcome.With LLMs, this went through two phases of shittifaction: first, there was a window where the safety people were hopeful about LLMs because the weren’t agents, so everyone and their mother declared that they would create an agent out if an LLM explicitly because they heard it was dangerous.This pleased the VCs.Second, they failed to satisfy the original definition, so they changed the definition of agent to the thing that they made and declared victory. This pleased the VCs",
