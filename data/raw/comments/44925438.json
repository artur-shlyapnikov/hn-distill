It makes it so that bookmarking neat things actually feels like it has a point, even if I don't always organize them in a way I can easily find later.[0] https://linkhut.org/",

Also just for \"vibe coding\", be really really careful if you're gonna make it a \"product\" because you'll definitely face rough situations through it.",

I really do look at the images every day so it is successful in that sense.  The web crawler started running into Cloudflare problems so now I save the whole page with the browser and have a Python script harvest the pages out of my Downloads folder.",
