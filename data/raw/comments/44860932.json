And to some degree handywork.It is a bit unfortunate, as I'm not at all interested in talking about those things - but they are such staple topics, that you can come off as a sort of outcast if you can't keep a short convo on those things.Another observation has been that some topics are very polarized. In some countries you can talk pretty freely about politics, while in other places it is a faux pas.But then again, part of finding out what the other party likes talking about is a skill in itself.",

A few weeks later I asked him if he'd setup any meetings with the team to get context and, you know, say hello and his response was \"why should I do that, can't they read my PRs?\". Classic.Another one was the very loudly self-diagnosed neurodiverse girl, who seemed to just use it as cover for being a total jerk.
