Entra ID doesn’t allow you to blacklist or whitelist specific tenants for multi tenant apps, which causes problems like this.Add the fact that MSAL doesn’t work for stuff like browser extensions, so people have to implement their own security solutions to interact with Entra ID and it’s not surprising there are so many issues.",

    "textPlain": "ohhhh the gifts multi-tenant app authorization keeps giving!(laid off) Microsoft PM here that worked on the patch described as a result of the research from Wiz.One correction I’d like to suggest to the article: the guidance given is to check either the “iss” or “tid” claim when authorizing multi-tenant apps.The actual recommended guidance we provided is slightly more involved. There is a chance that when only validating the tenant, any service principal could be granted authorized access.You should always validate the subject in addition to validating the tenant for the token being authorized. One method for this would be to validate the token using a combined key (for example, tid+oid) or perform checks on both the tenant and subject before authorizing access.

These sites shouldn’t have ever been exposed to public internet (they’re not now). Network security is such an afterthought but it’s the best layer of defense you can have!",

The underlying issue is that security is hard and in general there is no feedback loop except security incidents. Placing your apps in a intranet, or VPN, does nothing to mitigate this issue.",
