    "textPlain": "ohhhh the gifts multi-tenant app authorization keeps giving!(laid off) Microsoft PM here that worked on the patch described as a result of the research from Wiz.One correction I’d like to suggest to the article: the guidance given is to check either the “iss” or “tid” claim when authorizing multi-tenant apps.The actual recommended guidance we provided is slightly more involved. There is a chance that when only validating the tenant, any service principal could be granted authorized access.You should always validate the subject in addition to validating the tenant for the token being authorized. One method for this would be to validate the token using a combined key (for example, tid+oid) or perform checks on both the tenant and subject before authorizing access.

The guy found a way into build boxes retail Windows is built on, potentially found the private key that would be used to generate license keys, likely could have dived in a little bit more after getting RCE on the build box to exfil the latest Windows 11 source code. He even found a way to issue rewards. They still gave him nothing?",

They also own LinkedIn.This totally has no foreseeable potential consequences. It would be a real shame if some foreign hostile government with nuclear weapons managed to connect MS Account, LinkedIn Profile, and OpenAI accounts together by shared emails and phone numbers. Is it really worth starting a war for the crime of depantsing the nation?",

The issue being that once someone got into a VPN it was much, much harder to prevent them from accessing important data.So everything \"internal\" is now also external and required to have its own layer of permissions and the like, making it much harder for, e.g. the article, to use one exploit to access another service.[0] https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-zero-trust",
