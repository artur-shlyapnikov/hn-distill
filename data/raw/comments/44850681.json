    "textPlain": "NowÂ remember these dimwits are bragging that 30% of their code is now written by AI; and have mandated Microsoft Accounts, set up OneDrive backup by default, and are providing infrastructure to OpenAI who is currently required to preserve even deleted chats. They also own LinkedIn.This has no foreseeable potential consequences. It would be a real shame if someone managed to connect MS Account, LinkedIn Profile, and OpenAI account together.",
