Project Indiana was led by Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux Distribution.(I never understood the naming either)But here's an ArsTechnica article from 2007 talking more about those origins from back when Sun was still trying to win back marketshare from Linux. It had long since lost that war, but was still trying to stay relevant.https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/07/understanding-...Illumos based OS's have been kicking around a lot longer than I anticipated.",

As bad as MS is at extracting value out of its windows users, Oracle seems to fleece it's enterprise customers far, far worse.  I don't think I would ever choose Oracle or IBM for anything.It would be interesting to see a little more diversity in common operating systems in the wild though.  Linux has pretty much taken over the server space, and iOS/Android have split the more common usage outside that, with what's left of desktop still mostly Windows.I still think there's opportunity for something like Flutter as a cross-platform library that actually works with multiple backing languages.",
