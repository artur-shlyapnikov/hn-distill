Project Indiana was led by Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux Distribution.(I never understood the naming either)But here's an ArsTechnica article from 2007 talking more about those origins from back when Sun was still trying to win back marketshare from Linux. It had long since lost that war, but was still trying to stay relevant.https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/07/understanding-...Illumos based OS's have been kicking around a lot longer than I anticipated.",
