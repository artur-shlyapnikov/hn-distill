    "textPlain": "It's interesting that at the bottome of this article there is a recommened article  about PCIE 7.0 published in June 2025. And it says \"While PCIe 8.0 is still years away, PCIe 7.0 is a lot closer.\" Never know how these committees work.Nevertheless, the perf increases of IO devices these days are in insane. I am wondering whether and when these perf promises will materialize. We are only on PCIE 5 this year and it's not that common yet. I am wondering how fast adoptions would be, which pushes manufacturers to iterate. The thing is that at the current level of PCIE 5, a lot of softwares already need to be rewritten to take   full advantages of new devices. But rewriting softwares takes time. If software iterations are slow, it's questionable if consumers will continue to pay for new generations of devices.",
