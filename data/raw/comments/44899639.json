    "textPlain": "It's always been incredible to me that inflation is treated as though it emerges organically, \"aww shucks, I sure wish my money didn't keep losing value randomly!\"This is the result of policy decisions with well-understood outcomes. 0% interest rates for years, printing unprecedented amounts of money during COVID, historically high tariffs, etc.Now we'll all be 3%-10% poorer, in a single year, yet I see no accountability. In fact, I see people pressuring the Fed to lower (!) rates, the tariffs don't seem to be going anywhere, and government spending and debt are at all-time highs.I genuinely cannot understand this. If your actions will predictably make everyone poorer, and then the predictions come true, how can this not result in widespread loss of trust in governance?",
