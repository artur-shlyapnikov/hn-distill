    "textPlain": "The VF2 (original) is a stolid workhorse, as long as you only use it for simple CLI-based stuff.  The hardware is very well supported by Linux.  The performance isn't great, but I used it to fix hundreds of Fedora packages to add RISC-V support, so you can't really beat its effectiveness.  You do want to get the version with the max amount of RAM, and you'll also need to add an M.2 for storage (one PCIe lane!)",
