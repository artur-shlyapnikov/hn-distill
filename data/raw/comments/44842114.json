Sometimes different architectures have weird quirks (unexpected performance issues for some code, unexpected crashes). I guess only very few maintainers will investigate and fix those.It took quite some time until all software worked perfectly on arm/arm64. When the first Raspberry Pi was released, this was quite a different experience.",

The performance isn't great, but I used it to fix hundreds of Fedora packages to add RISC-V support, so you can't really beat its effectiveness.  You do want to get the version with the max amount of RAM, and you'll also need to add an M.2 for storage (one PCIe lane!)",

Right now they are barely useable outside of Raspberry Pi, which unfortunately has had supply issues.I know ARM chip makers can just rely on the smartphone, tablets and Roku market but since there is no such market for RISC-V they sort of have to be good as SBCs.",
