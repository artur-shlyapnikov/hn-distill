    "textPlain": "I've written this many times before, but working in some industry will usually expose you to the various problems that need to be solved. Most of the startup founds I've met have either worked in tech, or as consultants, and have noticed some problem that has been sitting unsolved / products that suck / untapped markets. And it is not like you need to be a FAANG SWE or McKinsey consultant enjoy to that privilege.Every time I've joined a new company, or been exposed to a new sector, I've almost immediately found some startup potential just sitting around. The more boring and entrenched the sector is, the more you find.As a consumer, you are rarely exposed to the B2B world, or the inner workings of things. You are almost certainty limited to seeing things through consumer eyes, and thus it is easy to focus too much on the very saturated products / services.",

    "textPlain": "A useful way to find ideas is by observing asymmetries. When something appears easy for some people but difficult for others, or vice versa, it often reveals underlying complexity, missing tools, or flawed mental models. Frustration can also be a signal. If something feels unnecessarily painful or awkward while others seem fine with it, there may be an opportunity to simplify, rethink, or build something better. These patterns often lead to meaningful insights or practical solutions.",

    "textPlain": "The real work in software engineering is deciding how to represent all the details of the problem and its solution - the rest is just typing. The ability to understand abstract systems in this way is very rare. For most people, computers are magical objects that they don't understand. You can't ask people what problems they have that you could solve with a computer because they have very little idea of what computers are capable of: you can't talk about a concept of an app, you have to build it and put it in front of them before they can contribute to a conversation about it.The days when a successful startup could be founded by a person who makes the thing and a person who sells the thing are over, because all the obvious ideas have been done. You need a third founder: the person with deep domain knowledge who knows what problems exist and which ones are worth solving.I think the PULL framework in the post is an unnecessary formalism. My advice for finding ideas is to get out of the ecosystem of companies in the Big Tech or Silicon Valley traditions and go and work for tiny little companies where all the office staff work in the same room and your job is to modernise a C++ application that has a hard dependency on Microsoft Office 2003 and runs on a VM running Windows XP (which was the first programming job I got when I left teaching in 2021). Those businesses are full of problems that are easily solved with computers, but no one who knows how to solve those problems has discovered those problems yet.",

It should have a business case so it’s something beyond pumped up idea to make world worse… I’ve seen enough startups that aimed to fix problems that never truly existed and generated more problems to speculate on an idea there actually is a business model for it.. I think debunked truth about startup ideas is to find a gig that fat boy investors buy in when you realize, cash out, buy a winery and relax… others will keep fixing problems you’ve generated, but wine tastes good. All other ideas is just bollocks for young minds to be lied that world we live in is not feudal.
