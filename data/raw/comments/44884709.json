It’s ironic that the very platform meant to keep apps open and accessible is now bottlenecked by outdated hardware.Upgrading the build farm CPUs seems like the obvious fix, but I’m guessing funding and coordination make it less straightforward. In the meantime, forcing devs to downgrade AGP or strip baseline profiles just to ship feels like a pretty big friction point.Long term, I wonder if F-Droid could offer an optional “modern build lane” with newer hardware, even if it means fewer guarantees of full reproducibility at first.
