    "textPlain": "It seems quite implausible that F-Droid is actually running on hardware that predates those instruction set extensions. They're seeing wider adoption by default these days precisely because hardware which doesn't support them is getting very rare, especially in servers still in production use. Are you sure this isn't simply a matter of F-Droid using VMs that are configured to not expose those instructions as supported?",

Will FDroid update their servers? Are google looking into rolling back the requirement? (this last one sounds unlikely)",

Although I'm basing this on one person's comment and other people agreeing, not on any knowledge or experience.> But this is like everything with F-Droid: everything always falls on a deaf man's ears. So I would rather not waste more time talking to a brick wall. If I had the feeling it was possible to improve F-Droid by raising issues and trying to discuss how to solve them I wouldn't have left the project out of frustration after years of putting so much time and energy into it.",
