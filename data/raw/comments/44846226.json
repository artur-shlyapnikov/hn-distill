I drink one black coffee in the morning.After all these years of IF, net-net I haven't lost any weight, but I find if I stop IF (i.e. I start eating 3 meals a day), I feel sluggish. So in the absence of doing anything else, at least IF keeps my mind sharp.p.s. the only times I've lost weight is when I've fasted once a week, cut out 50% of all carbs from diet, and starting lifting weights. I lost water weight at first, then plateaued because I gained muscle, then after that muscles did the work of burning excess calories.I was that way for at least 3 years. Then I decided I loved food too much and added certain carbs back into my diet. These days I just do IF and nothing else, and my weight is stable.",

Merely eating the same amount of food but in a certain time frame (which is what a lot of people end up doing) doesn’t accomplish much in terms of weight loss.But I have found to successful in breaking habits that if maintained properly, do help you lose weight.For example, I had a bad habit of eating a large breakfast 1-2 hours within waking up. I was never really that hungry, but it was just something I did out of habit. Doing an IF routine made me realize that I’m not actually that hungry in the morning and can get by until 10-11am on just a coffee with milk.",

    "textPlain": "I have read that before the Industrial Revolution, most people faced famine for about 10% of their lives. And while, historically, that would have probably been concentrated into a few bad years during their lifetime (months of starvation, during a few bad years), if we were to generalize that and make it a rule, it would work out to 3 days a month.There is some evidence that there are health benefits that are specific to the fasting mode. This has mostly been studied in the context of chemotherapy, where fasting can protect against some of the side-effects of chemotherapy:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5870384/Most of this has only been studied in animals, not humans, but in animals the results were clear:\"Fasting before chemotherapy (CT) was shown to protect healthy cells from treatment toxicity by reducing the expression of some oncogenes, such as RAS and the AKT signaling pathway [2]. This reduction is mediated by the decrease of circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and glucose. In addition, starvation and calorie restriction activate other oncogenes in cancer cells, induce autophagy, and decrease cellular growth rates while increasing sensitivity to antimitotic drugs [2].\"If we assume that we have been shaped by millions of years of frequent famine, then our evolution has been shaped by famine. It is possible that our immune system simply makes the assumption that we will soon face famine, and therefore some important tasks, such as extreme autophagy, are normally postponed till the famine arrives. However, in the modern era the famine never arrives, and so we may have to induce it by artificial means.I have experimented with very long fasts. My longest fast ever was in September of 2015 when I managed to go 12 straight days on nothing but water.Obviously, any health benefits from that incident might have been psychosomatic, since I was expecting health benefits. But all the same, I did find some of the health benefits to be shocking and c",

Microvariations across your current body state, body temperature, and even the time of day can influence how efficient your gut is at absorbing incoming energy.Some people operate with a goal of a caloric deficit of even something as small as e.g. 200kcal. But because all these things are impossible to measure accurately, a difference of just 10% beyond a daily BMR of 2000kcal isn't just a possibility; its the norm.

Intermittent fasting has been shown to match any other calorie deficit in terms of lean body mass loss, rather than more as you're implying.Regardless of how you lose weight the advice is and remains:> Eat a minimum of 0.36 grams of protein per day, per pound of LEAN* body weight. Increasing to 0.5-0.7 grams of protein per day, per pound of LEAN* body weight for older adults or when undergoing weight loss.*LEAN is a vital detail for overweight people, they commonly miscalculate protein requirements due to this. The easiest way for overweight people to determine their requirement, is just find an \"ideal body weight calculator\" online, enter height and gender, and then multiply THAT figure by 0.5-0.7.For example a man who is 6' tall and 400 lbs should eat 62 grams of protein per day MINIMUM, but during weight loss 86-120 grams of protein per day. It is common, unfortunately, to read online people in this situation miscalculate this to 280(!) grams of protein per day which is incorrect and harms their weight-loss goals.",
