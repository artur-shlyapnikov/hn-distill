    "textPlain": "I've been doing intermittent fasting (16:8) since 2016 (9 years).I have a belly and am what you would call \"a little chubby\". I don't exercise that much (once a week). I drink one black coffee in the morning.After all these years of IF, net-net I haven't lost any weight, but I find if I stop IF (i.e. I start eating 3 meals a day), I feel sluggish. So in the absence of doing anything else, at least IF keeps my mind sharp.p.s. the only times I've lost weight is when I've fasted once a week, cut out 50% of all carbs from diet, and starting lifting weights. I lost water weight at first, then plateaued because I gained muscle, then after that muscles did the work of burning excess calories.I was that way for at least 3 years. Then I decided I loved food too much and added certain carbs back into my diet. These days I just do IF and nothing else, and my weight is stable.",

    "textPlain": "Weight loss is linked with some loss of lean body mass, regardless of the method used. Intermittent fasting has been shown to match any other calorie deficit in terms of lean body mass loss, rather than more as you're implying.Regardless of how you lose weight the advice is and remains:> Eat a minimum of 0.36 grams of protein per day, per pound of LEAN* body weight. Increasing to 0.5-0.7 grams of protein per day, per pound of LEAN* body weight for older adults or when ungoing weight loss.*LEAN is a vital detail for overweight people, they commonly miscalculate protein requirements due to this. The easiest way for overweight people to determine their requirement, is just find an \"ideal body weight calculator\" online, enter height and gender, and then multiply by 0.5-0.7.For example a man who is 6' tall and 400 lbs should eat 62 grams of protein per day MINIMUM, but during weight loss 86-120 grams of protein per day. It is common, unfortunately, to read online people in this situation miscalculate this to 280(!) grams of protein per day which is incorrect and harms their weight-loss goals.",

    "textPlain": "Alternate day fasting normally means you eat up to 500 calories on your fasting day, but then eat more than usual on normal days. So on average if you eat 500 one day and 2500 another, that is no different than eating a restricted diet of 1500 every day. The finding here is that the former results in slightly more weight loss than the latter. That restrictions in calorie intake will result in weight loss is a given.",
