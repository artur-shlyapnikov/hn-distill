    "textPlain": "As a high school teacher with a multi ethnic classroom, I don't believe that scheduling is significantly a multi-cultural issue, but rather it's a specific school and community issue. For instance the time at which school starts is less downstream of puritan or protestant heritage, and more a matter of when the sun rises, and how far the busses have to travel. It emerges from lots of discussion with parents and staff.One thing that came out of those discussion is a four-day school week. That is popular with rural parents across cultures.The fact that some of our students come from a White or Hispanic or Native American heritage doesn't enter into the conversation, other than through their individual expressed preferences. Some cultures tend to speak more quietly and it's up to us to listen carefully. But we care about what those parents care about, not what our assumptions about their culture would lead us to guess they care about.",

There are studies showing significant associations of mobile phone use and poor sleep quality.[0]  I don't get the feeling that a strong link between mobile phone use and poor sleep quality would appeal to the Journal of Political Philosophy, though.[0] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9707689/ in India, https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.... in UK",
