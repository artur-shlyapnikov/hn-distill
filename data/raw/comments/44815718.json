It is all public, and when you open a category (a static site), all the information appears all at once and you can Ctrl-F for keywords.  It might not solve that \"unknown unknown\" problem that the author mentions, but it is certainly much preferable to the solution that our university used (https://www.his.de/hisinone; one example: all courses are displayed in a tree and if you click to unfold a node, the server generates verbose HTML and sends it to the client.  This takes at least 10 seconds on good days).",

Among the points discussed, the one about structures that can be read by machines (machine-readable formats) seems to hold important implications for the future of data structures and representation.While there are many attempts being made today, at the current pace of change I can imagine us returning to a clean, well-structured, text-based origin. As for UI representation, I believe AI will likely handle that on its own.",
