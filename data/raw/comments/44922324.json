The TLDR is simply that it's hard to stay focused, minor distractions cost you more productivity than you think, and the effect is even cumulative over long periods of time.There's lots of research on the topic and there are many ways to address the problem.

That's not true for everybody everywhere all the time. If we're generalizing from one sample, then I for one actually don't have a ton of distractions at my open plan office, and I love to be able to talk to my coworkers once in a while. I don't usually get more work done or even enjoy doing it more at home, except in some rare scenarios. I still dislike the open plan office, but this isn't why.

The fact that isolation improves your productivity isn't exclusively an effect of being at home. You are not being allowed to organize and keep on track and on task with the distractions, as you so record in your data. When people on the production line in my company get distracted, problems occur. Thus I try to make sure absolutely nothing can go wrong when they start a job up, and leave no reason for others to come around to cause or create a distraction. The only times anyone should be getting distracted or called upon is first article or final inspection, and that's (usually) it. Every other person has set tasks and I'll give them some slack time on the line so they don't have their brains clock out on the monotony of some of the highly-repetitive tasks and thus generate mistakes.Since I walked into the company 5 years ago, production has increased roughly an order of magnitude. Just let your employees work undistracted and without stupid meetings that do nothing for their productivity, and reap the benefits.Or you can just succumb to Agile and be non-productive beyond belief.
