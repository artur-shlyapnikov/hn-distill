Instead, browsers (correctly in my view) decided to be as flexible as possible to render pages in a best-effort way, because everyone had a slightly different way to build web pages.I feel like people get too stuck on the \"correct\" way to do things, but the reality of computers, as is the reality of everything, is that there are lots of different ways to do things, and we need to have systems that are comfortable with handling that.",

Both have their uses and if you get the information you need using one or the other, we are all happy.I think the example query here actually shows a problem with the query languages used in web search rather than an intrinsic inability of web search.  It contains what amounts to a natural language subquery starting with \"in the same year\".  In other words, to evaluate this query properly, we need to first evaluate this subquery and then use that information to evaluate the overall query.  Google Search and almost all other traditional web search engines use intentionally oversimplified query languages that disallow nested queries let alone subqueries, so this example really is just revealing a problem with the query language rather than a problem with web search overall.

[1] The problem is that the tools that we can use to access it are not being developed by Big Tech. Remember Freebase? Remember that Google could have easily kept it around but decided to fold it and shoved it into the structured query results? That's because Google is not interested in \"organizing the world's information and make it universally accessible\" unless it is done in a way that it can justify itself into being the data broker.I'm completely out of time or energy for any side project at the moment, but if someone wants to steal my idea: please take a llm model and fine tune so that it can take any question and turn it into a SparQL query for Wikidata. Also, make a web crawler that reads the page and turns into a set of RDF triples or QuickStatements for any new facts that are presented. This would effectively be the \"ultimate information organizer\" and could potentially replace Wikidata as most people's entry page of the internet.[0]: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/QuickStatements_3.0[1] https://guides.library.ucla.edu/semantic-web/datasets",

Humans just aren't good or fast at writing down the rather fuzzy semantics of the real world into a computer readable format.With RDF specially, there was also the issue of \"WTF is this good for?\". Semantic Web sounds lofty in theory, but was there ever even a clear plan on how the UI would look like? How would I explore all that semantic data if it ever came into existence? How would it deal with link rot?And much like with RSS, I think a big failure of RDF is that it's some weird thing outside the Web, instead of just some addition HTML tags to enrich existing documents. If there is a failure, it's that. Even today, a lot of basic semantic tags are missing from HTML, we finally got <date> in 2011, but we still have nothing for names, cities, units, books[1], movie, gps coordinates and a lot of other stuff we use daily.Another big failure is that HTML has become a read-only format, the idea that one uses HTML as a source format to publish documents seems to have been completely abandoned.

And most importantly: the knowledge and the connections would remain accessible and comprehensible, not hidden within impenetrable AI models.It's a pocket hope of mine that AI brings us back to the Semantic Web, or something very like it. In many ways these embeddings are giant non-human lexicons already. Distilling this information out seems so possible.Even just making an AI to go markup (or uhh perhaps refine) a page with microdata seems conceptually very doable!More broadly, looking at personal computing: my personal belief is that failure is hugely because of apps. Instead of a broader personal computing that aggregates, that allows constructivism, that enables personal growth & development (barefoot developers & home-cooked software style), computing has been defined by massificstion, by big tech software. The dominant computing paradigm has been mainframe pattern: we the user have an app that acts as a terminal to some far off cloud-y data center. Whatever agency we get is hewn out for us apriori by product teams, and any behavior not explicitly built in is a \"Felony Contempt of Business Model\" (an oh so accurate Doctorow-ism)! https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40633029 https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/20/benevolent-dictators/#fel... https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33279274It is so so sad to see computing squandered so!The good news is AI is changing this relationship with software. I'm sure we will have no end of AI models built in to our software, that companies will maintain the strict control (tyrant's grip) over software as lo",
