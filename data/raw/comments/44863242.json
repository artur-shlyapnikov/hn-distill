Traffic sent today is at risk of decryption unless post-quantum key agreement is used.\"I don't believe we'll ever get quantum computers. This is a waste of time\"Some people consider the task of scaling existing quantum computers up to the point where they can tackle cryptographic problems to be practically insurmountable. This is a possibilty. However, it appears that most of the barriers to a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer are engineering challenges rather than underlying physics.\nIf we're right about quantum computers being practical, then we will have protected vast quantities of user data. If we're wrong about it, then all we'll have done is moved to cryptographic algorithms with stronger mathematical underpinnings.Not sure if I'd take the cited paper (while fun to read) too seriously to inform my opinion the risks of using quantum-insecure encryption rather than as a cynical take on hype and window dressing in QC research.",

It would be silly to delay PQC adoption because of focusing on the irrelevant bad papers.In the past ten years, on the theory side, the expected cost of cryptographically relevant quantum factoring has dropped by 1000x [1][2]. On the hardware side, fault tolerance demonstrations have gone from repetition code error rates of 1% error per round [3] to 0.00000001% error per round [fig3a of 4], with full quantum codes being demonstrated with an error rate of 0.2% [fig1d of 4] via a 2x reduction in error each time distance is increased by 2.If you want to track progress in quantum computing, follow the gradual spinup of fault tolerance. Noise is the main thing blocking factoring of larger and larger numbers.

But signatures aren't an urgent issue, as there is no \"decrypt later\" scenario for signatures.For encryption, the overhead exists, but it isn't too bad. We are already deploying pqcrypto, and nobody seems to have an issue with it. Use a current OpenSSH and you use mlkem. Use a current browser with a server using modern libraries and you also use mlkem. I haven't heard anyone complaining that the Internet got so much slower in recent years due to pqcrypto key exchanges.Compared to the overall traffic we use commonly these days, the few extra kb during the handshake (everything else is not affected) doesn't matter much.",

    "textPlain": "As a number of people have observed, what's happening now is mostly about key establishment, which tends to happen relatively infrequently, and so the overhead is mostly not excessive. With that said, a little more detail:- Current PQ algorithms, for both signature and key establishment, have much larger key sizes than traditional algorithms. In terms of compute, they are comparably fast if not faster.- Most protocols (e.g., TLS, SSH, etc.) do key establishment relatively infrequently (e.g., at the start of the connection) and so the key establishment size isn't a big deal, modulo some interoperability issues because the keys are big enough to push you over the TCP MTU, so you end up with the keys spanning two packets. One important exception here is double ratchet protocols like Signal or MLS which do very frequent key changes. What you sometimes see here is to rekey with PQ only occasionally (https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/).- In the particular case of TLS, message size for signatures is a much bigger deal, to a great extent because your typical TLS handshake involves a lot of signatures in the certificate chain. For this reason, there is a lot more concern about the viability of PQ signatures in TLS (https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/pqc-signatures-2024/). Possibly in other protocols too but I don't know them as well",

Public-key (asymmetric) cryptography is already very expensive compared to symmetric even under classical, that's normal, what it's used for is the vital but limited operation of key-exchange for AES or whatever fast symmetric algorithm afterwards. My understanding (and serious people in the field please correct me if I'm wrong!) is that the potential cryptographically relevant quantum computer issue threats almost 100% to key exchange, not symmetric encryption. The best theoretical search algorithm vs symmetric is Grover's which offers a square-root speed up, and thus trivially countered if necessary by doubling the key size (ie, 256-bits vs Grovers would offer 128-bits classical equivalent and 512-bits would offer 256-bits, which is already more than enough). The vast super majority of a given SSH session's traffic isn't typically handshakes unless something is quite odd, and you're likely going to have a pretty miserable experience in that case regardless. So even if the initial handshake gets made significantly more expensive it should be pretty irrelevant to network overhead, it still only happens during the initiation of a given session right?",
