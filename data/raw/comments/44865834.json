Do that until you die.A non-system: skip a meal and just eat soup for 30 days and try to drop 10kg.Not diet advice and some people may need to drop weight quickly under doctor advise. But the general idea is to avoid will-power driven outcomes and rely on habit and system driven outcomes.Not clever org mode needed. To develop a habit just do it every day. Track it somehow. Make it not too onerous. Forgive slip ups.",

You're not building up points so you can buy a whole pizza and 3 beers.  You're doing this because this is you now.  This is the reward, being able to run miles in the heat.  Right now, sweat all over you, breath going in and out.  This is the reward.\"  For some reason that worked for me.",
