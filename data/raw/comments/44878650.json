    "textPlain": "This is pretty cool and feels like we're heading in the right direction, the whole idea of being able to hop between devices while claude code is thinking through problems is neat, but honestly what excites me more is the broader pattern here, like we're moving toward a world where coding isn't really about sitting down and grinding out syntax for hours, it's becoming more about organizing tasks and letting ai agents figure out the implementation details.I can already see how this evolves into something where you're basically managing a team of specialized agents rather than doing the actual coding, you set up some high-level goals, maybe break them down into chunks, and then different agents pick up different pieces and coordinate with each other, the human becomes more like a project manager making decisions when the agents get stuck or need direction, imho tools like omnara are just the first step toward that, right now it's one agent that needs your input occasionally, but eventually it'll probably be orchestrating multiple agents working in parallel, way better than sitting there watching progress bars for 10 minutes.",
