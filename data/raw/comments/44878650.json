    "textPlain": "This is pretty cool and feels like we're heading in the right direction, the whole idea of being able to hop between devices while claude code is thinking through problems is neat, but honestly what excites me more is the broader pattern here, like we're moving toward a world where coding isn't really about sitting down and grinding out syntax for hours, it's becoming more about organizing tasks and letting ai agents figure out the implementation details.I can already see how this evolves into something where you're basically managing a team of specialized agents rather than doing the actual coding, you set up some high-level goals, maybe break them down into chunks, and then different agents pick up different pieces and coordinate with each other, the human becomes more like a project manager making decisions when the agents get stuck or need direction, imho tools like omnara are just the first step toward that, right now it's one agent that needs your input occasionally, but eventually it'll probably be orchestrating multiple agents working in parallel, way better than sitting there watching progress bars for 10 minutes.",

It is sort of like Rich Hickey's hammock driven development taken to its ideal form. While you are on the go and have an idea, rather than writing it down in your todo list you can kick off an agent and have a prototype PR waiting for you next time you are at your desk.Once you start running coding agents async you realize that prototyping becomes much cheaper and it is easier to test out product ideas and land on the right solution to a problem much quicker.I've been coding like this for the past few months and can't imagine life without being able to invoke a coding agent from anywhere. I got so excited by it we started building https://www.terragonlabs.com so we could do this for any coding agent that crops up.",

I'm starting to consider the recent trend of very \"fancy\" CLI utilities that treat the terminal as a kind of GUI as an anti-pattern. I mean, how much easier would it be to write a wrapper around CC if it were just a readline prompt.Yet these fancy terminal applications have become really trendy. I've been using Crush lately and I quite like it, but it's annoying to me that I can't copy and pasted from the terminal when it's running, and scrolling the buffer doesn't work as expected either, it somehow scrolls some kind of internal \"window\" instead. Again, making copy & pasting annoyingly difficult.Is anyone making a good agent system that is just \"> Output\", \"$ input\" without trying to get crazy with ANSI escape sequences?  Some color is nice, but I think that should be the end of it.",

I have been using it everyday for engineering work, and it really is feeling like how you describe; my job is now more about organizing tasks, explaining them well, and providing critique, but just through talking to the computer. For example, when going through the git diffs of what the agents wrote, I will be speaking out loud any problems I notice, resulting in voice -> text -> markdown tree updates and these will send hook notifications to claude code so they automatically address feedback.",

For me those outside activities help me clear my mind and think about tough problems or higher level stuff. The thought of directing agents to help persist and refine fleeting thoughts/ideas/insights, flesh out design/code, etc is intriguing",

My ideal vision for the future is that agents will be doing all grunt work/implementation, and we'll just be guiding them.Can't wait til I'm coding on the beach (by managing a team of agents that notify me when they need me), but it might take a few more model releases before we get there lol",

Burnout is common in open source.\n* At the end of the day, it is still a lot of work, even guiding an LLM\n* Anything hosted is a chore.

Now, though, you literally have no idea what you're looking at or if it is decent.Claude made four different message passing implementations in my vibe coded app. \nI realized this once it was trying to modify the wrong one during a fix. In other words, claude was falling over trying to support what it made, and only a dev could bail it out. I am perfectly capable of coding this myself, but you have two choices at the moment--invest the labor, or get crap.
