Instead of going person by person, pick your rightmost “in progress” column and get an update on that issue. What’s needed? Who needs to help? That sort of stuff.I find this moves through the standup fairly quickly and puts the focus on how to get things done. It also highlights when something isn’t clear for the team and you can follow up after.",

Blockers should be notified right away and most teams do this over slack or other messaging platforms they use.> encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharingTeams are usually small, and if you don’t already know what someone is doing, you wouldn’t care what they have to say during the daily, and if you care what they have to say, you already know what they are doing.> building a sense of team ownership and support.Just go for a coffee break.If you believe daily standups are useful, chances are you’re actually part of the problem.",
