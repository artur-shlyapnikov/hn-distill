    "textPlain": "As much as I don't like facebook as a company, I think the jury reached the wrong decision here. If you read the complaint[1], \"eavesdropped on and/or recorded their conversations by using an electronic device\" basically amounted to \"flo using facebook's sdk and sending custom events to it\" (page 12, point 49). I agree that flo should be raked over the coals for sending this information to facebook in the first place, but ruling that facebook \"intentionally eavesdropped\" (exact wording from the jury verdict) makes zero sense. So far as I can tell, flo sent facebook menstrual data without facebook soliciting it, and facebook specifically has a policy against sending medical/sensitive information using its SDK[2]. Suing facebook makes as much sense as suing google because it turned out a doctor was using google drive to store patient records.[1] https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/55370837/1/frasco-v-flo...[2] https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.37... page 6, line 1",

As part of that exercise I was looking at the potential revenue figures for some free apps.One developer had a free app to track some child health data.

But when asked about the economics of his free app, the developer felt confident about a big pay day.As per him the app's worth was in the data being collected. I don't know what happened to the app but it seemed that app developers know what they are doing when they invade privacy of their users - under the guise of \"free\" app. After that I became very conscious about disabling as many permissions as possible and especially not using apps to store any personal data, especially health data.",
