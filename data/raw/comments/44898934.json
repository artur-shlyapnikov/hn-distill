    "textPlain": "As much as I don't like facebook as a company, I think the jury reached the wrong decision here. If you read the complaint[1], \"eavesdropped on and/or recorded their conversations by using an electronic device\" basically amounted to \"flo using facebook's sdk and sending custom events to it\" (page 12, point 49). I agree that flo should be raked over the coals for sending this information to facebook in the first place, but ruling that facebook \"intentionally eavesdropped\" (exact wording from the jury verdict) makes zero sense. So far as I can tell, flo sent facebook menstrual data without facebook soliciting it, and facebook specifically has a policy against sending medical/sensitive information using its SDK[2]. Suing facebook makes as much sense as suing google because it turned out a doctor was using google drive to store patient records.[1] https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/55370837/1/frasco-v-flo...[2] https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.37... page 6, line 1",
