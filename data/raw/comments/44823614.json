    "textPlain": "'Piracy killed the Amiga' is often repeated. But piracy also made the Amiga legendary.The Amiga just never got a serious update to those custom chips that made it such a great machine. AGA didn't bring much to the table (couldn't match the SNES/Megadrive). Accelerator cards and RAM expansions weren't enough. Then Doom arrived on PC, Commodore died, and it was all over.(Didn't help that once Doom arrived, so many of the remaining Amiga coders stopped making 2D games and spent countless hours trying to imitate Doom on a machine that didn't have a chance of delivering a good Doom-like experience...)",

A top-10 game music track of all time.But regarding the A500mini version, I thought SC2 was one of the bundled games that was a bit too difficult to control using the included gamepad and that is probably more fun with a joystick? Or maybe I am just getting old.",
