    "textPlain": "The irony about getting treatment for ADHD is that medical providers make it very hard to get the proper medication and treatment. People with ADHD are horrible at following through and handle rejection poorly. So the worse the ADHD is, the less likely somebody will be able to actually get treatment for it. A lot of people suffer because doctors fear losing their license like so many did during the pain pill debacle. It's a risk for them to prescribe a stimulant, but zero risk to tell you to eff off.As many have said in this thread, most doctors will tell you to go away or give you Welbutrin (which works poorly, if at all). I feel for your struggle.",

My belief is that ADHD is not a disease, nor a disability (even though it acts like one very frequently) and in fact there is evidence that ADHD is an important part of our evolution as a species.The problem(s) mostly relies with the modern way of life and what is expected from the society at large. In that context I try to feel ok when I daydream while I have countless of boring things to take care of as I totally feel ok when I hyperfocus in a creative endeavor.The meds are just a tool that I use no more than two times per week in order to take better care of myself and others. It is not a therapy and it's not me. I believe that Sensitive Rejection Dysphoria is very real for people like us, but the worst version of it is when you reject yourself because you are different and you try hard to be someone else.",

Because of the abuse potential they charge a fairly steep fee (cad $3k+, with a $2k+ autism assessment addon) to even attempt diagnosis (after screening by your GP — referral required).The intake paperwork alone was perhaps 100 pages of online questionnaires that lead to interviews where they schedule counselling and evaluation sessions with you.It took me almost a year to complete because 100 pages of “often always sometimes never” multiple choice questions (with attention checking red herrings) proved to be an almost insurmountable barrier for me.I ended up completely surrendering to their scheduling requests: “just book it and tell me when it is. I will adjust my schedule around you. Agreeing on mutually free times with six providers is a functional impossibility. Just book it. Now. Go. Lock it in.”It took a year to get through the maze and now they’ve booked me ASAP: three months out.If I have an opportunity to give feedback it will be that they badly need people on their team with lived experience. It makes sense that a system designed by people who were able to complete multiple years of medical education and training is effectively blind to conscientiousness and executive function deficits.Then again, perhaps the maze is another preventative measure: if you are able to speedrun it, perhaps you shouldn’t get medical meth.",

I don't think this is purely caused by the medication, I think it is stress related as well, but my doctor's only course of action right now is to reduce and re-evaluate my medsOn one hand, being medicated was incredible for me. It felt like it finally let me overcome my demons and be the person I wanted to be and always knew I was capable of beingOn the other hand, if it led to my current situation it's probably one of the worst choices I could have ever made. I hate having massive holes in my memory like this, and being burned out this way is extremely difficult to bearSo...

Back to Kaiser in 2024, I was routed to the same psychiatrist who once again wouldn't budge on adderall and once again recommended Welbutrin.I used an online clinic to get my assessment (which I understand isn't taken seriously) which is what she cited. I asked what aspect of the assessment documentation did she think left me unqualified and she cited marijuana use in 2016. I asked her how she squares the fact that I'm an adult professional that makes comparable money to her, I have experience using both wellbutrin and adderall and see the former doing nothing and the latter helping,\nthere's hundreds of times more evidence for adderall efficacy vs the flakey data on wellbutrin...

ADHD and autism spectrum disorders are highly correlated with it.A friend who is an audiologist was out with me at an event and basically spotted the adaptations that I had adopted subconsciously over my life (I’m in my 40s). I then got tested and confirmed. It’s likely a result of many consecutive ear infections I had as a kid.When reading up on APD, the literature describes stories of various people… and it was like looking back on a story of my life. The ADHD correlation is thought to be related because of the way the brain develops (or doesn’t) in the presence or absence of stimuli.I say this because it would be easy to dismiss my scenario. By most measurements I’m successful and doing great. But had I known or maybe been treated in the past, certain difficult aspects of my life would have likely been managed better or avoided.

Pilots will avoid getting diagnosed and medicated because it will kill their career, even though medication may make them safer.(I suspect ADHD pilots would handle takeoff and landing very well, as well as emergencies, but oh god the checklists and schedules and that whole middle part of the flight…)",

    "textPlain": "Not saying it can't be the methylphenidate, but I would suspect it likely has more to do with your career than you might be giving it credit for.  I don't know what your background is but, since you're on HN, I can make an educated guess and say you work in tech, which can both be a highly rewarding career but also one that can really drain the soul.  The worst part about the soul-sucking is that our jobs are superficially very comfortable, so it's easy to talk yourself into just appreciating what one has and ignore your feelings.I recommend giving up caffeine if you haven't done so.  That alone had a much greater impact on my daily functioning than taking breaks from my medication.  It took my body a week to recalibrate, but my mentality and my energy has been way more even throughout my days.  The nice thing too is I can sometimes have caffeine when I feel like I can benefit from it and it actually has a positive effect rather than just keeping you barely at baseline for a few hours.",

When you spend your whole life basically unable to work in the way you want to, it can be intoxicating to finally be productive.It's genuinely hard to describe how good it feels.  But it's important to slow down and objectively evaluate how much work and time you are putting in, because burn-out is always a risk.---Edit to add - memory holes are also a pretty common effect of high stress levels.  If you really got into work and doubled or tripled down on your effort once you got medicated it could easily be causing some of the effects you are experiencing.",

    "textPlain": "Wanna add my 2c here, I feel you strongly. I had a similar path, getting medicated in my 30s and feeling like it destroyed barriers I had been struggling with my entire life. But it has resulted in some negatives as well, like you mentioned.My hypothesis is that people like myself, and maybe you, have adapted ourselves to being productive with our pre-medication brains. You can only do it at certain times, for short bursts, and in particular ways. It's not really in your \"control\" how it happens, so you come to terms with doing work when you can. Then, when you become medicated, you don't need to do that anymore. It's exhilarating. You can just work like everyone else does. The problem is that other people have lived their entire lives learning how to balance that kind of drive and we haven't, so we go overboard and grind ourselves down.Additionally being on the meds all the time can fuck up your sleep. Sleep debt is no joke and the meds get less effective when you're tired ime. I've had memory issues as well and I chalk it up to the sleep debt almost entirely. The obvious answer is to take breaks, but it turns out you need to be able to effectively execute on the weekend too. There aren't that many viable time slots to take a vacation from responsibilities. It's such a faustian bargain and I deeply dislike that we're saddled with this bizarre maladaptation for modern life.",

    "textPlain": "I feel this. It's so very hard to manage one's medicated-ADHD productivity in a way that feels useful but doesn't burn like a white-hot flame.My boss has been supportive and really helped me see the ways in which I was causing myself burnout, encouraging me (as a senior tech IC) to write things down, do more knowledge and skill transfer, and delegate more. That helped me a lot.What I used to think of as \"autonomy,\" which I valued so highly, following the shiny problems that made my brain happy, was more lone wolf behavior than I like to admit, and not serving me very well career-wise, as it was hard to document or sell what I was doing.I also had to privately learn how to pace myself, setting realistic, appropriate and prioritized daily goals (nevermind the arm's-long TODO list). Checking myself against those, aiming for better goal-setting each day. Being able to close the laptop when it's done. I never really had a sense of \"done\" before, I had a lifetime of feeling always-behind. There's this peace, though, that comes with realizing that you _can_ prioritize effectively, do the things, then rest. That peace can become its own reward, which is bananas to me, because my unmedicated brain would never have felt that.Speaking of which, I might never have had the head-space to work on things like this if I hadn't gotten medicated five years ago. My career has improved and stabilized. For the first time in my life I've stayed at a job for more than three years. Been promoted. Been able to see a future that doesn't just involve running from a job when things get too hard and starting again.The side effects can be a beast, though. I wonder to myself how many more years I'll be able to manage them.I wish you the best in finding your way back to a place that works for you.",

Finding the right dose took some trial and error, and to be honest \"the right dose\" is something that will probably vary throughout my life based on how good my non-medication ADHD management is going. But for me it's been life-changing without burning me out, and it's been almost 7 years.I also think even without the medication the diagnosis is worth it.
