People with ADHD are horrible at following through and handle rejection poorly. So the worse the ADHD is, the less likely somebody will be able to actually get treatment for it. A lot of people suffer because doctors fear losing their license like so many did during the pain pill debacle. It's a risk for them to prescribe a stimulant, but zero risk to tell you to eff off.As many have said in this thread, most doctors will tell you to go away or give you Welbutrin (which works poorly, if at all).

The risk reductions were more pronounced for recurrent events, with reduced rates for all five outcomes. This target trial emulation study using national register data provides evidence that is representative of patients in routine clinical settings.",

I asked what aspect of the assessment documentation did she think left me unqualified and she cited marijuana use in 2016. I asked her how she squares the fact that I'm an adult professional that makes comparable money to her, I have experience using both wellbutrin and adderall and see the former doing nothing and the latter helping,\nthere's hundreds of times more evidence for adderall efficacy vs the flakey data on wellbutrin...

You can only do it at certain times, for short bursts, and in particular ways. It's not really in your \"control\" how it happens, so you come to terms with doing work when you can. Then, when you become medicated, you don't need to do that anymore. It's exhilarating. You can just work like everyone else does. The problem is that other people have lived their entire lives learning how to balance that kind of drive and we haven't, so we go overboard and grind ourselves down.Additionally being on the meds all the time can fuck up your sleep. Sleep debt is no joke and the meds get less effective when you're tired ime. I've had memory issues as well and I chalk it up to the sleep debt almost entirely. The obvious answer is to take breaks, but it turns out you need to be able to effectively execute on the weekend too.

    "textPlain": "I didn't get a diagnosis _at_ Kaiser SF, but I was able to get meds through them. Maybe this will be of use to you.I was diagnosed by a non-Kaiser psychiatrist I found on my own. After trying different prescriptions, we eventually settled on Concerta. I stayed on that (and continued seeing the same psychiatrist, whose service I paid for out of pocket) for about 4 years.Then my psychiatrist had some family stuff come up and had to move out of California. Since she was no longer going to be licensed here, she couldn't keep prescribing my meds to me. But she was able to write a letter describing my situation and laying out how she'd arrived at the prescription I was on, with particular emphasis on the fact that she hadn't seen any evidence of misuse on my part. I gave that letter to my Kaiser primary care doctor, who agreed to take over the prescription. After that I was able to get my meds from Kaiser each month without any issues.I imagine this kind of setup depends on your primary care doctor; I may have just gotten lucky with mine.",

    "textPlain": "When I was on Kaiser, it was an absolute nightmare trying to get any traction. They had me do a computer test and, I guess because the results of it (which aren't disclosed to you) did not indicate ADHD, they would not consider the wealth of documentation I had ready to take a look at my old school records. I asked for a second opinion and the next psychiatrist they assigned to me was aloof and refused to consider anything, either. They did give prescribe me bupoprion which did absolutely nothing for me (though I have heard it works for others).I'm now on a PPO plan and have been using Vyvanse for over a year now. It's lead to a dramatic improvement in my quality of life. I grieved for the time and opportunities I had lost due to not having been diagnosed and treated in childhood.HMOs have a lot of upsides, but Kaiser's behavioral healthcare is awful (at least in the DC Metro area) and there's not much recourse unless you want to/can afford to pay out of pocket.There's so much cynicism about ADHD even existing, even among healthcare professionals. Any time on HN any mention of ADHD seems to invite a lot of cynicism as well. That, compounded with that one of the most effective treatments for it is something that pretty much everyone can see a positive effect from (stimulant medication), makes it really difficult to navigate.I hope that you can find a better option because it seems like Kaiser is just very antagonistic towards ADHD.",

    "textPlain": "This is exactly my experience. I got diagnosed as some variant of bipolar 9 years ago and put on a mood stabilizer, but the symptoms never really fit. I’m in general high functioning and got great grades up through postsecondary, didn’t start really having a problem until I started experiencing burnout after having kids during the pandemic.  Got evaluated for ADHD, psychiatrist focused on childhood symptoms. Refused to prescribe anything for ADHD because ADHD meds can cause manic episode in bipolar patients, they put me on Wellbutrin instead. Wellbutrin (which affects different people very differently) caused me to have a crisis and spent a week in inpatient care at a non-Kaiser facility.It was the best thing that has happened to me in years. Inpatient psychiatrist disagreed with the bipolar diagnosis and said that inpatient care was a safe space so we could try Adderall and a different antidepressant (Lexapro). On Adderall I feel calmer, less anxious, and if I’m tired it actually puts me to sleep, which is all in line with ADHD patients. I can focus at work again and have my life back.I don’t feel like I’ve “lost” anything on Adderall, I would describe my experience with ADHD as having a buggy thread scheduler that would overallocate CPU time to background threads. On Adderall I feel like I have control again. I can still daydream, but all 5 trains of thought are not trying to enter the station at the same time.I’ve had 3 different Kaiser psychiatrists and all have been sub-par, refusing to re-visit prior diagnoses, being aggressive and overly rigid in their own opinions, and sometimes just being plain incompetent. My recommendation is to seek mental health care from somewhere outside Kaiser that accepts Kaiser insurance. Kaiser’s mental health division is oversubscribed and probably underpaid. Overall our experience with Kaiser has been that no matter which division you’re dealing with, you have to be pushy and advocate for yourself or they’ll just slap the easy l",
