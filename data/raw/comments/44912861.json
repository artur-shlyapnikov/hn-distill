    "textPlain": "The irony about getting treatment for ADHD is that medical providers make it very hard to get the proper medication and treatment. People with ADHD are horrible at following through and handle rejection poorly. So the worse the ADHD is, the less likely somebody will be able to actually get treatment for it. A lot of people suffer because doctors fear losing their license like so many did during the pain pill debacle. It's a risk for them to prescribe a stimulant, but zero risk to tell you to eff off.As many have said in this thread, most doctors will tell you to go away or give you Welbutrin (which works poorly, if at all). I feel for your struggle.",

The risk reductions were more pronounced for recurrent events, with reduced rates for all five outcomes. This target trial emulation study using national register data provides evidence that is representative of patients in routine clinical settings.",

My belief is that ADHD is not a disease, nor a disability (even though it acts like one very frequently) and in fact there is evidence that ADHD is an important part of our evolution as a species.The problem(s) mostly relies with the modern way of life and what is expected from the society at large. In that context I try to feel ok when I daydream while I have countless of boring things to take care of as I totally feel ok when I hyperfocus in a creative endeavor.The meds are just a tool that I use no more than two times per week in order to take better care of myself and others. It is not a therapy and it's not me. I believe that Sensitive Rejection Dysphoria is very real for people like us, but the worst version of it is when you reject yourself because you are different and you try hard to be someone else.",

Because of the abuse potential they charge a fairly steep fee (cad $3k+, with a $2k+ autism assessment addon) to even attempt diagnosis (after screening by your GP — referral required).The intake paperwork alone was perhaps 100 pages of online questionnaires that lead to interviews where they schedule counselling and evaluation sessions with you.It took me almost a year to complete because 100 pages of “often always sometimes never” multiple choice questions (with attention checking red herrings) proved to be an almost insurmountable barrier for me.I ended up completely surrendering to their scheduling requests: “just book it and tell me when it is. I will adjust my schedule around you. Agreeing on mutually free times with six providers is a functional impossibility. Just book it. Now. Go. Lock it in.”It took a year to get through the maze and now they’ve booked me ASAP: three months out.If I have an opportunity to give feedback it will be that they badly need people on their team with lived experience. It makes sense that a system designed by people who were able to complete multiple years of medical education and training is effectively blind to conscientiousness and executive function deficits.Then again, perhaps the maze is another preventative measure: if you are able to speedrun it, perhaps you shouldn’t get medical meth.",

I asked what aspect of the assessment documentation did she think left me unqualified and she cited marijuana use in 2016. I asked her how she squares the fact that I'm an adult professional that makes comparable money to her, I have experience using both wellbutrin and adderall and see the former doing nothing and the latter helping,\nthere's hundreds of times more evidence for adderall efficacy vs the flakey data on wellbutrin...

    "textPlain": "This is a common belief people have, especially those with mild ADHD or those who wish to be dismissive of the disorder.Unfortunately, in reality while there are some very limited advantages, as a whole ADHD is a whole-brain dysfunction where your neurons are literally incapable of maintaining their level of operation as long as in a healthy person, with ALL of your executive functions - all self-regulation, planning, delaying gratification, emotion management, etc - being impaired across the board, not just tuned differently.Hyperfocus is commonly brought up, but neurotypical people experience it as well. Less often, but also without the compulsive loss of control, while being able to maintain a higher level of effort and work without it at all times.People also like to claim we'd be better as lookouts or sentries but this isn't true. People with ADHD don't pay more attention to a broader range of things, they're just incapable of focusing it when necessary, not to mention they drift off and get distracted instead of staying watchful far, far more.That's before getting into the fact that ADHD correlates negatively with pretty much every single life outcome, not just those depending on society - things like neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular and metabolic problems, sleep disturbance, etc.I understand the desire to frame things you're experiencing in a positive manner, but... in this case, it doesn't really work, and I somewhat resent it personally, as it makes people less likely to take ADHD as seriously as it needs to be.",

If someone doesn't fit into the mass education model, they say they have attention deficit.

It makes no sense.The mass education model where hundreds of people sit on a chair listening to lectures for hours on end just isn't right for people with ADHD.
