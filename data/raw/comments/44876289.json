Come join! https://tangled.sh/signup. The goal is to be the new town square for collaborating with friends and open source communities.It's built fully in the open (https://tangled.sh/@tangled.sh/core) and we have a neat little community built around it on our Discord https://chat.tangled.sh.Last night was a ton of fun with the sudden influx of users thanks to the GitHub news. :)",

It's easy enough to stand up your own Gitea or Forgejo instance for mirroring personal Git repos, set up your own GitLab instance for more sophisticated collaboration and CI workflows, etc...but the discoverability GitHub provides in its current form, since the vast majority of repos are hosted there (or at least have some kind of mirror there) is unparalleled.",

The first mover with escape velocity wins.The amount of energy needed to undo that is massive.You'll have fringe 0.01%ers adopt some other tool, but they'll never carry enough gravitas to bring the entire network with them.Anecdotal evidence:- Github, Facebook, and Reddit have never been unseated- Instagram has never been replaced, only supplemented- Twitter/X has only lost steam due to extremely bad press, an unwanted name change, and a huge effort from Meta (which leveraged traffic and synergy from Instagram). And even then, it's still well within the public zeitgeist. Bluesky and Mastodon didn't even make dents.- Google has never been displaced (granted, Google pays a lot of money to maintain defaults and maintain a web \"pane of glass\" monopoly, redefine the address bar as a search bar, etc.)",
