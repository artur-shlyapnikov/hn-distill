It is more likely that there have been that many cumulative downloads, and even that seems to be a high number.  Given that Windows has .zip file support built-in for quite some time, and the fact that nearly nobody downloads .zip files anymore, makes me very suspicious of this kind of statistic.[1] https://www.win-rar.com/",
