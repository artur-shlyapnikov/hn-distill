    "textPlain": "> WinRAR, aÂ utility for compressing files, and has an installed base of about 500 million.Yeah, right.Edit: this figure is possibly taken from the WinRAR website [1].  It is more likely that there have been that many cumulative downloads, and even that seems to be a high number.  Given that Windows has .zip file support built-in for quite some time, and the fact that nearly nobody downloads .zip files anymore, makes me very suspicious of this kind of statistic.[1] https://www.win-rar.com/",
