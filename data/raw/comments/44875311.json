Isn't %LOCALAPPDATA% commonly used to store executables for programs that want to install for a single user and not the whole computer? An example of which includes Google Chrome?",

It is more likely that there have been that many cumulative downloads, and even that seems to be a high number.  Given that Windows has .zip file support built-in for quite some time, and the fact that nearly nobody downloads .zip files anymore, makes me very suspicious of this kind of statistic.[1] https://www.win-rar.com/",
