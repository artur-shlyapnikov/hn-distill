    "textPlain": "I looked at the Framework Desktop a few week ago; mainly to get something that has nicer gaming performance than my laptop's iGPU. I'm not a big gamer really, but as of late I've been wanting to play some things, like The Witcher 3 (saw thread on Reddit celebrating its 10 year anniversary: \"that's the new one I still need to play\", so that's about how up to date I am with games – some of these \"new\" games are already classified as \"good old game\" on gog.com).My take-away was/is that the Framework Desktop is a very nice machine, but it is expensive IMHO. You can get better performance at a lower price by building your own machine; in this article the 9950X scores lower than the Max 395, and I'm not entirely sure that's accurate – that wasn't my take-away at all (don't have links at the ready). This is also what you'd expect when comparing a 55W laptop chip vs. a 170W desktop chip.That said, Linux compatibility is a bit of a pain, for example some MediaTek WiFi/Bluetooth chips that ASUS boards use don't have a Linux driver. In general figuring out what components to get is a bit time-consuming. In one of the videos Nirav mentioned that \"just get the Framework Desktop\" is so much easer, and 100% agree with that.In the end, I decided to get a USB4/Thunderbold eGPU, which gives me more than enough gaming performance for me and is much cheaper. I already have a laptop that's more than performant enough for my needs, which I got last year mainly due to some idiotic JS build process I had to deal with last year that took forever on my old laptop. On the new machine it's merely \"ludicrously slow\". Sometimes I think JS people are in cahoots with Intel and/or AMD...For LLM stuff the considerations might be different. I don't care about that so I didn't look into it.",

A China-aligned/sponsored group has made an UEFI rootkit targetting ASUS/Gigabyte mainboards: https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/vulnerability-managem... Why not require/compel certain companies to implement them directly?",

    "textPlain": "I was surprised at previous comparison on omarchy website, because apple m* work really well for data science work that don't require GPU.It may be explained by integer vs float performance, though I am too lazy to investigate. A weak data point, using a matrix product of N=6000 matrix by itself on numpy:  - SER 8 8745, linux: 280 ms -> 1.53 Tflops (single prec)\n  - my m2 macbook air: it is ~180ms ms -> ~2.4 Tflops (single prec)\n\nThis is 2 mins of benchmarking on the computers I have. It is not apple to orange comparison (e.g. I use the numpy default blas on each platform), but not completely irrelevant to what people will do w/o much effort. And floating point is what matters for LLM, not integer computation (which is what the ruby test suite is most likely bottlenecked by)",
