It creates a safer online world for some.> In particular the foundation is concerned the extra duties required - if Wikipedia was classed as Category 1 - would mean it would have to verify the identity of its contributors, undermining their privacy and safety.Some of the articles, which contain factual information, are damning for the UK government. It lists, for example, political scandals [1] [2]. Or information regarding hot topics such as immigration [3], information that the UK government want to strictly control (abstracting away from whether this is rightfully or wrongfully).I can tell you what will (and has already) happened as a result:1. People will use VPNs and any other available methods to avoid restrictions placed on them.2. The next government will take great delight in removing this law as an easy win.3. The likelihood of a British constitution is increasing, which would somewhat bind future parliaments.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_scandals_in_...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_sca...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_immigration_to_the_Unit...",

So he’s been using the foundation’s money to lobby for the expansion of his unelected quango.It has also been suggested that one of the largest beneficiaries of this law, an age verification company called Yoti, also has financial ties to Carnegie UK.It’s difficult to verify that because Yoti is privately held and its backers are secret.It’s not as if anyone was surprised that teenagers can get round age blocks in seconds so there’s something going on and it stinks.1. https://carnegieuk.org/team/william-perrin-obe/",

It is a product of a world that many politicians still don't understand. But those politicians still make laws that do not make sense, because they believe that something has to be done against those information crimes. And they also do it to score brownie points with their conservative voting base.The internet has it's problems, no doubt about that.

Isn't it better than UK legislation?The whole idea that every site or app must do verification is stupid. It would be much easier and better to do verification at the store when buying a laptop, a phone or a SIM card. The verification status can be burned in firmware memory, and the device would allow only using sites and apps from the white list. In this case website operators and app developers wouldn't need to do anything and carry no expenses. This approach is simpler and superior to what UK does. If Apple or Microsoft refuse to implement restricted functionality for non-verified devices, they can be banned and replaced by alternative vendors complying with this proposal. It is much easier to force Apple and Microsoft - two rich companies - to implement children protection measures than thousands of website operators and app developers.",

    "textPlain": "This is about the duties of a \"category 1 service\" under the Online Safety Act. Wikipedia is one mostly because of their size, I believe. These duties are quite onerous, and over the top (someone might say that the government is seeing adults are real \"snowflakes\" these days):Large user-to-user services, known as Category 1 services, will be required to offer adult users tools which, if they choose to use, will give them greater control over the kinds of content they see and who they engage with online.Adult users of such services will be able to verify their identity and access tools which enable them to reduce the likelihood that they see content from non-verified users and prevent non-verified users from interacting with their content. This will help stop anonymous trolls from contacting them.Following the publication of guidance by Ofcom, Category 1 services  will also need to proactively offer adult users optional tools, at the first opportunity, to help them reduce the likelihood that they will encounter certain types of legal content. These categories of content are set out in the Act and include content that does not meet a criminal threshold but encourages, promotes or provides instructions for suicide, self-harm or eating disorders. These tools also apply to abusive or hate content including where such content is racist, antisemitic, homophobic, or misogynist. The tools must be effective and easy to access.

It is ok to be responsible for what you're posting. We are living in the age of global irresponsibility.And it doesn't mean Wikimedia must make the identities public. Same as any other website -- real identity to be provided only to authorities following a court order.Also, there's a ton of bots and paid agents working full-time to shift political opinions to their political agenda.",

I think there has to be some kind of strong constitution that guarantees aforementioned rights. But I also think it's instructive to look at America wrt how that can go awry - ie their constitution is routinely ignored, and a lot of the political decision making is done by fifth columnists lobbying for a foreign nation.Regardless, we need to start having these conversations. It's not a matter of getting different people into Westminster. Westminster is illegitimate. Let's think about what's next and how we can get there peacefully.",
