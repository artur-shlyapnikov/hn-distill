When I first read the paper I didn't really register what the LUMENX+ was. https://www.cellink.com/bioprinting/lumen-x/ I had no idea these guys were an operation.As for the paper, the media flow idea and execution is awesome, but I'm curious how long they have been able to maintain proliferation after testing at 7 days.Also it's \"bioink\" not \"bionk\" on page 2.. :)",
