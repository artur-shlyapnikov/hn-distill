They then get a certificate from the government that has the fields they are allowed to request stored within it.Websites can request data from the user by sending that certificate, it opens the app, it shows you the categories of data to be send, you hold your ID card to the phone, enter the PIN, and the certificate is uploaded to the ID card which verifies it. If its valid, the ID sends back the data that is specified in the certificate.You then get presented with exactly the data that is going to be sent to the website. You can then agree or disagree. So far that is only used to log in to government websites.This way the government does not know which sites you visit, and you only send your age to the website.",

    "textPlain": "The big problem I have with laws like the UK has been that they solve a non-issue at the cost of large infrastructure and potential privacy problems.Teenagers have been looking at porn since forever.  It's practically a trope of teens stealing their parents' porn mags.  I don't think any of this has actually caused major societal issues.The proposed solutions merely require that a teen steal their parent's identification, briefly, to create a porn account and move on.  Heck, they can probably buy that information online if they are innovative enough.  They certainly will be selling access to their porn accounts to their classmates.  And even if they don't go through all that trouble, getting a porn mag is still pretty possible in the UK.That makes this just a bad law.  It doesn't meaningfully stop the problem it's meant to stop and it's expensive and intrusive.  Even if privacy preserving age verification was bulletproof and perfect, you still have the access holes all over.And then there's the simple fact that other nations exist.  Yes, mainstream sites will put up protections, but what about the sealand porn site?  Unless the UK wants a great firewall (ala the chinese firewall), they simply aren't going to stop this problem.  Even then, VPNs are common knowledge at this point due to streaming.Bad law, bad effects, and a pointless fight.",

That isn't going to stop people from trying, and we will end up with a worse system overall. IMO this is a common pitfall of techno-idealists.Technologies like the mdl standard [1] can attest to age without revealing the users identity.As Cory points out, its still possible for kids to swipe someones ID and use that. There are probably practical solutions that are good enough. Android, iOS, and parents could work together to deal with the problem of stolen IDs. If mdl is implemented on devices such that they are managed by the device OS, that would lead to auditability. Parents can ask their child to see their phones ID app, which will show full roster of IDs on the child's device. If a parent sees an ID that shouldn't be there, they can have a conversation about it. In this way the law would be about empowering parents to shape their child's online experience. This is just a straw-man example solution, but there may be better ones.The other objections I saw could be worked through in a similarly pragmatic fashion.This is probably going to be good enough for most folks, and its probably a good thing to keep children away from pornography and such. And IMO coming up with a \"good enough\" solution will flush out all the bad actors who are hiding behind the excuse of \"save the children\" when really they want to build up an record of everyone's browsing history. But by denying any solution to a real problem, we let the bad actors hide amongst the well-intentioned folks who are trying to do the right thing.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_driver%27s_license",

Once the user is authenticated, he can generate a nonce and a blinding factor, multiply them together to get a blinded random number, and upload that to the government for signing. He takes the signature and unblinds it, then submits the original nonce and unblinded signature to the adult website. The website confirms that the nonce and signature is valid according to the government's public key.This system raises many questions. For example, preventing replay attacks, so the adult website will reject any nonce being reused, or mandating that a timestamp be a subcomponent of the nonce. There is the un-answerable question of how to handle the case where a legitimate adult offers valid signatures for someone else to use. There is also the question of, to what extent the adult website should be able to keep track of the underlying users (even in a hashed format) to monitor abuse, suspicious users who have too much activity, etc.",

    "textPlain": "If you're a web person who understands SSL, privacy-preserving age verification can be explained by analogy.It's a system which requires a central agency, probably a government agency, analogous to a certificate authority.You are authenticated with that agency; it has personal info about you. But you are externally identified by some impersonal identifier, not your name.The agency issues you a certificate binding this identifier to an assertion like \"is over 18 years old\".When you interact with a site that wants to know whether you are over 18 years old, you present the certificate.  The site can see that it's signed by the authority and that it has the assertion that you are over 18.You can't just give that site someone else's certificate because it has to be the one tied to the abstract identity you are presenting (which contains no personal info; it's some kind of UUID or whatever). Plus the cert can be bound to a specific device and such.The cert has a private keys with which you can prove that you own that cert; or at least that you are the authenticated operator of a device to which that cert was issued.It's something like that. I may have some key details wrong. The main idea is that some brokerage that does have info about you can attest that you are over 18 without revealing any of the personal info via certificate-like objects.It sounds like, in theory, the system can achieve good privacy in age verification. But not perfect age verification; people will find ways around it.A grown up can certify themselves to be over 18 and then hand the device to a teenager; and such an operation can likely be scaled to some extent. And of course no cryptographic system can eliminate the possibility that minors are looking at the screen of a device operated by an adult, who may even step out of the way to let them operate it.",
