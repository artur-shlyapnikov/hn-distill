    "textPlain": "GPT-5 is better as a conversational thinking partner than GPT-4o. It's answers are more concise, focused and informative. The conversation flows. GPT-5 feels more mature than GPT-4o with less juvenile \"glazing.\"I can't speak to other uses such as coding, but as a sounding board GPT-5 is better than GPT-4o, which was already pretty good. GPT-5's personality has definitely shifted to a more professional tone which I like.I do understand why people are missing the more synchophant persoanlity of GPT-4o, but I'm not one of them.",
