It’s also still orders of magnitude faster than doing the research manually.I’m reminded of that Louis CK joke about people being upset about the WiFi not working on their airplane.",

    "textPlain": "GPT-5 is better as a conversational thinking partner than GPT-4o. It's answers are more concise, focused and informative. The conversation flows. GPT-5 feels more mature than GPT-4o with less juvenile \"glazing.\"I can't speak to other uses such as coding, but as a sounding board GPT-5 is better than GPT-4o, which was already pretty good. GPT-5's personality has definitely shifted to a more professional tone which I like.I do understand why people are missing the more synchophant persoanlity of GPT-4o, but I'm not one of them.",

Some of the responses I am receiving when asking trivial questions are now are merely a handful of sentences instead of a dissertation. However, dissertation mode comes back when appropriate, which is also nice.Edit: Slightly tangential, but I forgot to ask, do any of you all have access to the $200/month plan? If so, how does that model compare to GPT-5?",

    "textPlain": "API is noticeably slower for me, sometimes up to 10x slower.Upon some digging, it seems that part of the slowdown is due to the gpt-5 models by default doing some reasoning (reasoning effort \"medium\"), even for the nano or mini model. Setting the reasoning effort to \"minimal\" improves the speed a lot.However, to be able to set the reasoning effort you have to switch to the new Response API, which wasn't a lot of work, but more than just changing a URL.",
