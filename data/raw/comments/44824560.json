The main difference was training data.This is kind of weird and reductive, comparing specialist to generalist models? How good is GPT3’s game of Go?The post reads as kind of… obvious, old news padding a recruiting post? We know OpenAI started hiring the kind of specialist workers this post mentions, years ago at this point.",

    "textPlain": "I am quite happy that this post argues in favor of subject-matter expertise.  Until recently I worked at a national lab.  I had many people (both leadership and colleagues) tell me that they need fewer if any subject-matter experts like myself because ML/AI can handle a lot of those tasks now.  To that effect, lab leadership was directing most of the hiring (both internal and external) towards ML/AI positions.I obviously think that we still need subject-matter experts.  This article argues correctly that the \"data generation process\" (or as I call it, experimentation and sampling) requires \"deep expertise\" to guide it properly past current \"bottlenecks\".I have often phrased this to colleagues this way.  We are reaching a point where you cannot just throw more data at a problem (especially arbitrary data).  We have to think about what data we intentionally use to make models.  With the right sampling of information, we may be able to make better models more cheaply and faster.  But again, that requires knowledge about what data to include and how to come up with a representative sample with enough \"resolution\" to resolve all of the nuances that the problem calls for.  Again, that means that subject-matter expertise does matter.",
