    "textPlain": "I used Tor for surveillance.  But an appropriate kind, IMHO.I used Tor as a small part of one of the capabilities of a supply chain integrity startup.  I built a fancy scraper/crawler to discreetly monitor a major international marketplace (mainstream, not darknet), including selecting appropriate Tor exit nodes for each regional site, to try to ensure that we were seeing the same site content that people from those regions were seeing.Tor somehow worked perfectly for those needs.  So my only big concern was making sure everyone in the startup knew not to go bragging about this unusually good data we had.  Since we were one C&D letter away from not being able to get the data at all.(Unfortunately, this had to be a little adversarial with the marketplace, not done as a data-sharing partnership, since the marketplace benefited from a cut of all the counterfeit and graymarket sales that we were trying to fight.  But I made sure the scraper was gentle yet effective, both to not be a jerk, and also to not attract attention.)(I can talk about it now, since the startup ran out of runway during Covid investor skittishness.)",
