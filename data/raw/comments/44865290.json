    "textPlain": "Curious to see how this works out. The flight booking example is interesting because it’s one of the last purchase powers I’d want to hand over to an AI.If it gets a major travel detail wrong, purchases a business class ticket on accident, etc. and I need to adjust the booking by calling the airline, then I’m way less happy than I was if I just bought the ticket myself. Not to mention what happens when Google flights gets a UI refresh and knocks the accuracy rate of the agent down even 10%.Digital criminals are gonna love it, though.I’m personally much more interested in automating browser tasks that aren’t economically valuable because that mitigates the risk.",
