    "textPlain": "This is very interesting. I think a lot of people may be quick to overlook the value of such simulators when thinking about AI agents at the extremes. (Either they're not good enough to trust or they're so good they'll leapfrog over any economic value here.)My own experience makes me lean toward thinking that the truth is somewhere in the middle in this situation, and that simulators like these will be valuable. I've been experimenting a lot with computer use on my website Bingeclock, passing through different prompts along the lines of \"make a movie marathon based on X.\" The newest agents are consistently impressive, while also being consistently imperfect in surprising and interesting ways.Whether or not all the labs are already running this kind of thing internally for themselves, you would know better than I. But it's an idea that seems very useful nonetheless. Congratulations on the launch!",

    "textPlain": "Curious to see how this works out. The flight booking example is interesting because it’s one of the last purchase powers I’d want to hand over to an AI.If it gets a major travel detail wrong, purchases a business class ticket on accident, etc. and I need to adjust the booking by calling the airline, then I’m way less happy than I was if I just bought the ticket myself. Not to mention what happens when Google flights gets a UI refresh and knocks the accuracy rate of the agent down even 10%.Digital criminals are gonna love it, though.I’m personally much more interested in automating browser tasks that aren’t economically valuable because that mitigates the risk.",

    "textPlain": "Computer use agents are starting to perform well on websites/apps that are in their training distribution, but still struggle a lot when dealing with tasks outside their distribution. A big reason why is because many more niche/enterprise applications are really hard to test on in the real world, hence the need for sims!re: labs doing this internally. They definitely are! However, the scale of sims buildout is going to be massive, probably many orders of magnitude above what we have today. We think it makes sense for one central player to do this because a really good simulator can be used by multiple people at once. It doesn’t make sense for every AI lab/company to build out their own environments if an industry standard catalog exists.",

    "textPlain": "yup, though without access to the code it's much harder to pull the state of the components - becomes more like a web scraping problem, it's a brittle and much hackier than just intentionally exposing component state like we can do in the sim.more importantly though are use cases that depend on the data. the data on real google flights/expedia is constantly changing, so it's impossible to build datasets based ground truth, e.g. the answer for a task like \"Find the cheapest round-trip flight option from Bologna (BLQ) to Dushanbe (DYU) if I leave on 2026-05-05 and come back on 2026-05-15. Return the total price and the flight numbers for all flights.\" isn't stable. on our site, we control the data, so that answer is stable (deterministically random). so controlling the whole clone rather than running on the prod site unlocks richer and more repeatable tasks/testing.lastly, our site runs the exact same locally as deployed, it has zero internet dependencies. so it can be run offline directly on the cluster with no issue for network latency/failures",

A great example is Epic in Healthcare. SO much labor is employed just to write and read information from this desktop app that isn't easily accessible. Imagine a computer use system that can do automated data pulls at scale for legacy desktop apps. This is a huge huge use case, and something that we're excited to try and improve with simulators of things like Epic, SAP, Salesforce, etc.Consumer: Lots of just general everyday tasks.
