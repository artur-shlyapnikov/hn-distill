This is also why most food handling gear in manufacturing is blue coloured. Easy to see.Vaguely related,there was a small chemical spill near my house about a month back and it made it to the local creek. You could tell because they add that neon blue dye so that it is obvious when there is a spill.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/17/banyule-...",

Let us count the ways.They are invasive and cause millions of dollars in agricultural damage each year, rooting and trampling through a wide variety of crops. They prey on everything from rodents, to deer, to endangered loggerhead sea turtles, threatening to reduce the diversity of native species. They disrupt habitats. They damage archaeological sites. They are capable of transmitting diseases to domestic animals and humans. In November, a woman died in Texas after being attacked by feral hogs—a very rare, but not unprecedented occurrence.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/feral-pigs-are-inv...",
