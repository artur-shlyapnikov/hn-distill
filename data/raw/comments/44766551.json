The Emperor himself had to be called in multiple times (which was unprecedented) to ensure that the surrender was 'pushed' through. Even after the vote to surrender happened there were still machinations to overturn it: a reminder that there was a coup attempt to prevent the surrender from being broadcast:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyūjō_incident",

Truman had spent the past decade dealing with the war in his capacity as senator and vice president - seeing the effects it was having first (or second) hand.Now, this isn't to say that America was right or not right to drop one or both bombs. It may \"feel\" like I'm saying \"the Japanese deserved it for their behavior\" - that's not a belief I hold, either.I just want to provide color for why American leadership seemed so relatively unconcerned with the lives of Japanese civilians in 1945.",

    "textPlain": "Here’s an extraordinary piece that focuses on the stories of the ordinary lives of the real people surviving 64 kilo enriched uranium exploding above their head yielding a blast of approximately 15 kiloton TNT which caused a fireball with a diameter of 370m that had the same surface temperature as the sun (source: Wikipedia). And here we are, the intellectually curious people of the internet, above all interested in offsetting these tragedies to some other suffering statistics. Why can’t we help but look away from human suffering inflicted by war, even if there’s a moving long read focusing on real people presented to us? And who does this thinking serve?Towards the end of the piece, the author describes a science professor who, together with his son, lays buried under the rubble of his house after the blast. He ultimately survives but reflects about laying there, thinking: “It was my first time I ever tasted such a beautiful spirit when I decided to die for our Emperor.” How fascinating this is the spin you give to such a traumatising experience. Are we really nation state citizens first, human beings second? Could speaking about the fate of the people of Hiroshima in terms as ‘necessity’ and ‘justified’ be a symptom of the same thinking? How do we get out of this?",

If the atomic bomb was first developed by the Japanese, they wouldn't have hesitated to use it just like the USA did. Does it make it more right?

The atomic bombs weren't even the deadliest events of the war—see the firebombing of Tokyo.",

You see this spectrum of though across many Asian countries from the authoritarian ones like China to the more democratic like Singapore.Unlike the West which has a history of the relationship of the individual with the government and its leadership, Asia is much more influenced by Confucianism.While people like to describe it as “what is good for the group versus what is good for the individual” I think that’s not an accurate description.  It’s much more of a belief that governance happens “up there” and isn’t relevant to a commoners life.The Eastern view of government is much more hierarchical and detached from the individual than in the West.  There is strong sense that any one individual is not that important overall and that governance is a realm of the upper class, with the lower class on the receiving end rather than where power originates.So for someone in Japan, the decisions during the war and the consequences thereafter are not theirs to judge or influence, only theirs to endure.
