Wayland sessions make up 82% of all sessions with telemetry enabled.https://blogs.kde.org/2025/03/15/this-week-in-plasma-file-tr...For me the real conundrum was SwayWM vs KDE Wayland rather than any X.org session; I really felt like SwayWM was a good upgrade from i3wm and gave me a better desktop session with much less hacks. Hope to see wlroots push forward and support some of the newer Wayland protocols, it has started to fall behind a little bit, but I think it's good for alternative desktops.",

However, it's clearly not _mature_ yet (which is understandable - it's very new!). My use case specifically is a bit unusual:1. I'm on an NVIDIA graphics card - this struggles a lot, I won't lie, and it's really odd issues which are difficult to track down.\n2. I'm running Deskflow for virtual KVM - this is using literally someone's hand-rolled attempt to hack Wayland to make it work - it manages the most important element: my keyboard and mouse are shared between my Linux desktop and my MacBook - but much of the incidental functionality, most notably copy-pasting and repeating held keys, doesn't work at all. Mod keys seem a bit fucky as well.That said, I'm committed - am excited to see the tech honed in the coming years.",
