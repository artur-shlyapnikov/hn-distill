Wayland sessions make up 82% of all sessions with telemetry enabled.https://blogs.kde.org/2025/03/15/this-week-in-plasma-file-tr...For me the real conundrum was SwayWM vs KDE Wayland rather than any X.org session; I really felt like SwayWM was a good upgrade from i3wm and gave me a better desktop session with much less hacks. Hope to see wlroots push forward and support some of the newer Wayland protocols, it has started to fall behind a little bit, but I think it's good for alternative desktops.",
