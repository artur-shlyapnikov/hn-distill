This is common everywhere, but I feel especially pronounced in communities like this. It also involves quite a bit of navel gazing that makes me feel a little sick participating in.The smartest people I have ever known have been profoundly unsure of their beliefs and what they know. I immediately become suspicious of anyone who is very certain of something, especially if they derived it on their own.",

Its even worse when extremely powerful people do this; they can reduce an enormous sub-network of thought into a single node for many many people.So, my answer for \"Why Are There So Many Rationalist Cults?\" is the same reason all cults exist: humans like to feel like they're in on the secret.

Their first question is going to be, \"What's the catch?\" Because at the very least they'll suspect that adjusting their work/life balance will bring a sizeable amount of stress and consequent decrease in their emotional well-being. And if the pitch is that this rationalist practice works equally well at improving emotional well-being, that smells to them. They already know they didn't logic themselves into their current set of emotional issues, and they are highly unlikely to logic themselves out of them. So there's not much value here to offset the creepy vibes of the pitch. (And again-- being in touch with your emotions means quicker and deeper awareness of creepy vibes!)Now, take a person whose unexplored emotional well-being tacitly depends on achievement.

None of these people have ever seen a demon, so world models including demons have never predicted any of their sense data.

The point being that.. humans have a pretty endless capacity to go ALL IN on REALLY WEIRD shit, as long as it promises to fix their lives if they do everything they're told. Naturally if their lives aren't fixed, then they did it wrong or have karmic debt to pay down, so YMMV.In any case, I'm considering the latent woo-cult atmosphere as a test of the skeptical inoculation that I've tried to raise my child with.",
