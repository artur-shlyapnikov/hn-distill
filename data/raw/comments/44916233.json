    "textPlain": "From main text:> Discussions with different stakeholders suggest that many currently perceive systematic fraudulent science as something that occurs only in the periphery of the “real” scientific enterprise, that is, outside OECD countries. Accumulating evidence shows that systematic production of low quality and fraudulent science can occur anywhere.From supplement (section about the output of the \"ARDA\" paper mill):> We obtained 20,638 documents and were able to impute country of authorship for 13,288 documents (64.4%). Of these documents, more than half were solely from India (26.4%), Iraq (19.3%), or Indonesia (12.2%).The identity and reputation of the authors, and the publication venue, is (for now) still a strong signal when evaluating the credibility of an article.The article is spot-on though in that there is a real risk of paper mills infecting formerly reliable journals, and this is not helped by the publishers' commercialism.  For example, it used to be easy to ignore Hindawi journals (they are characteristically low quality); then Wiley started publishing them under its own brand.  The good is now mixed with the bad under the same label.  Practicing scientists can fall back on whether they know the authors personally but that doesn't really help non-practicing professionals or the general public.",

    "textPlain": "I've been in industry and academia.My experience is that incentives within the two are converging: monetization drives all activities.Higher ed is allowing professors to slump teaching responsibilities - as it has for many years - in favor of high-flying research. What is new is that now: entire departments struggle to find chairs or people to run basic functions at teaching or research levels. Professors are rarely on campus except at the bare minimum and are largely diverting resources (people & research) to their companies.",

    "textPlain": "«The trends we expose forecast serious risks ahead for the scientific enterprise. Large groups of editors and authors appear to have cooperated to facilitate publishing fraud (Fig. 1). Networks of linked fraudulent articles suggest industrial scale of production (Fig. 2). Organizations selling contract cheating services anticipate and counter deindexing and other interventions by literature aggregators (Fig. 3). The literature in some fields may have already been irreparably damaged by fraud (Fig. 4). Finally, the scale of activity in the enterprise of scientific fraud already exceeds the scope of current punitive measures designed to prevent fraud (Fig. 5). Currently implemented punitive measures are not addressing the tide of fraudulent science.»This sounds pretty damning, and the figures mentioned (closer to the end of the article) are pretty revealing.Goodhart's Law gives rise to Sturgeon's Law :(",

So basically everyone is deceiving everyone else all the time? At least on the plus side, it did make me feel a little more optimistic about AI slop. A machine-written report rife with errors and fabrications is apparently at a parity with real human performance.",
