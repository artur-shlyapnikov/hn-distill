    "textPlain": "I dealt with this kind of thing for years, and for the most part grown out of it but it can still strike me out of nowhere.The feelings of the walls of the room suddenly racing away from you, or the feeling that your hands are suddenly 10x as big and everything you touch is tiny, are terrifying for a growing kid. Heck even talking about it now tingles those fears just a bit, but now I can for the most part logic myself out of it.I slept with a light on in my room for many years, that was the only thing that helped.",

    "textPlain": "When I had fevers as a child I would experience my perception of space and my place in it wildly growing and shrinking. For me it was a rapid flip-flop (gargantuan then tiny, repeat) and was nausea inducing (or perhaps it was coincident with sickness induced nausea). My memories of it were while in bed since that’s where I was most of the time when sick. Strangely the bed came with me.",
