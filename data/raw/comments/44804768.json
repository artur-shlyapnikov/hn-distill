Heck even talking about it now tingles those fears just a bit, but now I can for the most part logic myself out of it.I slept with a light on in my room for many years, that was the only thing that helped.",

For me it was a rapid flip-flop (gargantuan then tiny, repeat) and was nausea inducing (or perhaps it was coincident with sickness induced nausea). My memories of it were while in bed since that’s where I was most of the time when sick. Strangely the bed came with me.",

    "textPlain": "Interesting.  I never knew there was a name for this phenomena.  It happened to me every now and then as a kid, too, usually when I was sick and in bed.  In my case, it made me feel vertigo, like size scales were shifting around so fast I'd lose my balance and fall over, stuff like that, but I don't remember any particular fear reaction per se, other than feeling kind of gross when it happened.  I found that dim light (like a nightlight in a child's bedroom, with long shadows) was the worst trigger, and either bright light or complete darkness helped avoid it.",
