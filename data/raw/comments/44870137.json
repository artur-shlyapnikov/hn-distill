    "textPlain": "When I clicked I already thought about the comments that ask \"is this vibe coded\". So I kind of asked myself that question. As someone who manually codes as well as experiments with AI-assisted coding I ask myself what attitude we should develop towards AI-assisted coding in the long run. Right now on HN it almost seems like \"AI shaming\" at work. If you post a project that's a result of using AI you can expect a lot of critique around here. While I understand that to a certain extent I guess we also need to overcome that sentiment. After all we don't blame people using IDEs, code completion or other tools that have become the norm.",

    "textPlain": "I already have some experience with Python/PySide6, and I was mainly interested in having a working prototype as soon as possible (I’m experimenting with SDL3 and animating squares isn’t exactly thrilling!). Plus, Qt widgets integrate very well with Python, it is so easy to create a section, especially when the documentation is well written, that helps a lot. Also, with PyInstaller, the build process for each platform is fairly straightforward (although for customized icons, there are a few extra steps to take).There are some downsides of course (like the bundle size, for example), but that's not a problem, the core idea is: double-click on Tilf and start drawing right away.",
