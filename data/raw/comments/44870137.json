    "textPlain": "I already have some experience with Python/PySide6, and I was mainly interested in having a working prototype as soon as possible (I’m experimenting with SDL3 and animating squares isn’t exactly thrilling!). Plus, Qt widgets integrate very well with Python, it is so easy to create a section, especially when the documentation is well written, that helps a lot. Also, with PyInstaller, the build process for each platform is fairly straightforward (although for customized icons, there are a few extra steps to take).There are some downsides of course (like the bundle size, for example), but that's not a problem, the core idea is: double-click on Tilf and start drawing right away.",
