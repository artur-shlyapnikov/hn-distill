As someone who manually codes as well as experiments with AI-assisted coding I ask myself what attitude we should develop towards AI-assisted coding in the long run. Right now on HN it almost seems like \"AI shaming\" at work. If you post a project that's a result of using AI you can expect a lot of critique around here. While I understand that to a certain extent I guess we also need to overcome that sentiment. After all we don't blame people using IDEs, code completion or other tools that have become the norm.",

    "textPlain": "Latest Aseprite is still available with free (as in beer) source code to compile, even if it is a bit heavy on the dependencies these days, including requiring that you install a special fork of Skia iirc. I paid for it to get the pre-compiled binaries for Windows, but on Linux and OSX I always compiled it myself anyway. On FreeBSD, that is my desktop OS of choice now, I use the ancient open source version of Aseprite since that is what is most convenient to install (from the port). Maybe I should try Libresprite instead.For my programmer art I also use old (Autodesk) Animator (in DOSBox) a lot. It is small and runs anywhere. Perfect for doodling on my phone, with some configuration to add various on-screen buttons in DOSBox. Small enough (less than 1 MB) that the entire application plus all configuration and saved working files can go into every source code repository where I want to edit some pixel art. https://github.com/AnimatorProAlso have VGA Paint 386 installed in DOSBox everywhere. Have not used it much, but it seems good (probably more interesting for those that want something closer to a Deluxe Paint clone). https://www.bttr-software.de/products/vp386/Then there is https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama that is open source and seems to improve at a good pace. I just never took the time to look very close.Going to have a look at Tilf as well, to see if it is not too much work to get it to run in FreeBSD. Not being an expert in drawing anything, it helps to have many tools and switch between, as all tend to have something they do better (or easier) than the other ones.",

Also, with PyInstaller, the build process for each platform is fairly straightforward (although for customized icons, there are a few extra steps to take).There are some downsides of course (like the bundle size, for example), but that's not a problem, the core idea is: double-click on Tilf and start drawing right away.",
