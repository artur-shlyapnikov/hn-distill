    "textPlain": "Slight tangent: The enduring charm of \"retro\" games (whether actually old or just imitating old games) and the cults around old platforms, shows that there is some value in \"constrained computing\" environments. The PlayDate has also been moderately successful hasn't it?It often seems to result in increased creativity. Maybe partly because of the challenge of pushing those constraints, the level playing field (when competing vs all the other developers on such platforms), and/or the lack of \"pressure\" (i.e. you don't _have_ to make a game that looks like the latest Unreal 69 tech demo or whatnot)..Maybe it's time for a new current-day platform that's purposely \"constrained\"? The capabilities of the DS seem like a sweet spot. Put it in a Switch form factor and throw in a Commodore 64-like OS, complete with Python or Lua or some other language that's easy to pick up and also relevant in the broader world.",
