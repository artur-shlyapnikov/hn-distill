    "textPlain": "Slight tangent: The enduring charm of \"retro\" games (whether actually old or just imitating old games) and the cults around old platforms, shows that there is some value in \"constrained computing\" environments. The PlayDate has also been moderately successful hasn't it?The constraints often seem to encourage increased creativity. Maybe partly because of the challenge of pushing those constraints, the level playing field (when competing vs all the other developers on such platforms), and/or the lack of \"pressure\" (i.e. you don't have to make a game that looks like the latest Unreal 69 tech demo or whatnot)..Maybe it's time for a new current-day platform that's similarly \"constrained\" on purpose?The capabilities of the DS seem like a sweet spot. Put it in a Switch form factor and throw in a Commodore 64-like OS, complete with Python or Lua or some other language that's easy to pick up and also relevant in the broader world.",

    "textPlain": "Most of the charm of retro-computing is Nostalgia and yearning for the simplicity of older machines.I own two Amigas. The OS boots pretty quickly and you can start using your computer. Until the invention of NVMEs did I have a PC that would boot as quickly as the Amiga. There are no distractions when using the machine, no forced updates, no stupid notifications. It just works as a computer.I have a collection of Amiga, PS1, Dreamcast, PS2 and PS3 games. The games are relatively cheap and or free (a lot of games are abandonware or can be pirated without anyone really caring). Unlike a lot of modern titles are actual games. They are fun, pretty much just pop in the disk and play.",

And it fits your description of a modern-day platform that's constrained in particular ways. It has been interesting to see the ways devs have used the system to make unique games unavailable on any other platform.",
