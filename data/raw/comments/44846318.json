    "textPlain": "> I believe what is happening is that those images are being drawn by some script-kiddies. If I understand correctly, the website limited everyone to 1 pixel per 30 seconds, so I guess everyone was just scripting Puppeteer/Chromium to start a new browser, click a pixel, and close the browser, possibly with IP address rotation, but maybe that wasn't even needed.I think you perhaps underestimate just how big of a thing this became basically overnight. I mentioned a drawing over my house to a few people and literally everyone instantly knew what I meant without even saying the website. People love /r/place style things every few years, and this having such a big canvas and being on a world map means that there is a lot of space for everyone to draw literally where they live.",

Dang!I'm curious what the peak req/s is like. I think it might be just barely within the range supported by benchmark-friendly web servers.Unless there's some kind of order of magnitude slowdowns due to the nature of the application.Edit: Looks like about 64 pixels per km (4096 per km^2). At full color uncompressed that's about 8TB to cover the entire earth (thinking long-term!). 10TB box is €20/month from Hetzner. You'd definitely want some caching though ;)Edit 2: wplace uses 1000x1000 px pngs for the drawing layer. The drawings load instantly, while the map itself is currently very laggy, and some chunks permanently missing.",
