I've seen so many autistic people literally just nolifing and also collaborating on huge arts on wplace. It is absolutely not just script kiddies.> 3 billion requests / 2 million users is an average of 1,500 req/user. A normal user might make 10-20 requests when loading a map, so these are extremely high, scripted use cases.I don't know about that either. Users don't just load a map, they look all around the place to search for and see a bunch of the art others have made. I don't know how many requests is typical for \"exploring a map for hours on end\" but I imagine a lot of people are doing just that.I wouldn't completely discount automation but these usage patterns seem by far not impossible. Especially since wplace didn't expect sudden popularity so they may not have optimized their traffic patterns as much as they could have.",
