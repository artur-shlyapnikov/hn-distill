    "textPlain": "This looks interesting, but it is quite buggy. A few things I've found:- error handling is not good. It just dumps the error JSON in the console, and doesn't read and understand it, so keeps retrying even if it's something that it clearly needs to change- ESC is pretty unreliable at interrupting ongoing activity- I'd expect to be able to use arrow keys to navigate through history- is there a way to change the preference order for models?It succeeded in my standard task of adding support for detecting itself to am-i-vibing, but it got stuck in some API errors before it was able to create a PR. It does now have support though after a little help: https://github.com/ascorbic/am-i-vibing",

    "textPlain": "I'll add docs! Tl;DR: in the onboarding (or in the Add Model menu section), you can select adding a custom LLM. It'll ask you for your API base URL, which is whatever localhost+port setup you're using, and then an env var to use as an API credential. Just put in any non-empty credential, since local models typically don't actually use authentication. Then you're good to go.IMO gpt-oss-120b is actually a very competent local coding agent — and it should fit on your 128GB Macbook Pro. I've used it while testing Octo actually, it's quite good for a local model. The best open model in my opinion is zai-org/GLM-4.5, but it probably won't fit on your machine (although it works well with APIs — my tip is to avoid OpenRouter though since quite a few of the round-robin hosts have broken implementations.)",
