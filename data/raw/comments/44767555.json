While we often read books on database internals this one seems pretty relevant to any developer working on systems that scale. Hope to have you in the group!Also even if you don't want to join this particular reading, join the mailing list for the overall book club (on /bookclub.html) because we're going to read Designing Data Intensive Applications 2nd Edition together after it comes out this winter.",
